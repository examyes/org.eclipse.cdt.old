  <title>CDT Windows Debugger Readme</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a couple of things we are trying to experiment with this,
the CDT Windows Debugger. First we are using the Microsoft Visual C++
Toolkit with the Platform SDK as our tool chain. Second, we are using
Ant and cpptasks to run the build. As a result, there is some setup to
do before you can start building the plugins.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the Visual C++ Toolkit and Platform SDK available from
microsoft.com. Make sure the INCLUDE and LIB environment variables are
set to find the include files and libraries from these two installs.</li>
  <li>Download the latests cpptasks install from
ant-contrib.sourceforge.net. In Eclipse, in the Preferences,
Ant-&gt;Runtime, add the cpptasks.jar file to the classpath. Then
create a task called 'cc' and point it to the cpptasks.jar file, class
net.sf.antcontrib.cpptasks.CCTask. Finally add a Property java.home
that points to the root of your Java SDK install. This is required for
the JNI header files.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Finally install the Debugging Tools for Windows from the
Microsoft site. This install has the newest dbghelp.dll file that is
required for certain things in the CDT Windows Debugger to work. Copy
that file from this install to the lib folder in
org.eclipse.cdt.debug.win32.core.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that should be it. If you have any questions/comments or find
any mistakes, please drop a line to cdt-debug-dev@eclipse.org.<br>
