<h1>OProfile Sample Files</h1>

<p><i>Sample files</i> are collections of samples that were taken by the OProfile daemon. 
Unless the &quot;separate-libs&quot; or &quot;separate-kernel&quot; options are used, 
there is only one sample file per executable that ran on the system. 
These sample files contain <i>all</i> the samples colleted in the executable image. 
Thus, each run of an executable causes OProfile to output only one sample file.
</p>

<p>Using the &quot;separate-libs&quot; option for OProfile, you can cause
OProfile to track shared library samples for each program that uses it. 
These show up as children of the program in the <span class="guilabel">System Profile</span>
view and allow you to view a program's use of the shared library.</p>
