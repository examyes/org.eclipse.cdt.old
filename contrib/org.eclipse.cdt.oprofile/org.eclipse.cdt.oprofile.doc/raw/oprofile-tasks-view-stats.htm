<h2>Viewing overall system profiling statistics</h2>

<p>The <span class="guilabel">System Profile</span> view displays <i>sample files</i>,
that is, files that contain OProfile sample information. 
These sample files are
displayed as the original executable for which the sample was taken.
For example, the sample file
<span class="filename">/var/lib/oprofile/samples/}home}me}foo#0</span> would be displayed as
&quot;<span class="filename">/home/me/foo</span>&quot;, since this is the executable 
from which the event was collected.</p>

<p>To view sample counts for the entire system, select the
OProfile event to view in the <span class="guilabel">System Profile</span> 
view's menu. 
The menu shows a list of all the events collected by all sessions in the
OProfile samples directory. 
Note that not all events may exist in all sessions.</p>

<p>After choosing an event, select one of the sessions to view. 
The <span class="guilabel">System Profile</span> view shows 
all the executables for which the event was collected. 
(<i>Executables</i> can be shared libraries and kernel
modules, as well as conventional executables.) 
The <span class="guilabel">Sample</span> view displays count 
information for the samples collected for the chosen session. 
Specifically, the <span class="guilabel">Sample</span> view shows:</p>

<ul>

<li>The total sample <span class="guilabel">Count</span> 
for each executable for which there are samples.</li>

<li>The percentage (<span class="guilabel">%age</span>) of the total counts of this session
collected in this executable.</li>

<li>The <span class="guilabel">Name</span> of the executable.</li>

</ul>

<p>By default, the <span class="guilabel">Sample</span> view sorts the executables in order of
decreasing sample count; that is, it displays the
executable with the most samples at the top.</p>
