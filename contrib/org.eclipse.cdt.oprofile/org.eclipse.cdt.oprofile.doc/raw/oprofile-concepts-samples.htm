<h1>OProfile Samples</h1>

<p>OProfile <i>samples</i> are simple data: an address at which the sample was collected
and a count of the total number of times a sample was collected at the address.
</p>

<p>Note that the term &quot;sample&quot; is misleading: OProfile does not really sample
executables. 
Instead, OProfile uses the performance counters available on modern CPUs. 
When an event occurs (such as a cache miss), the performance counter is incremented. 
When the counter passes a given maximum, the counter is reset, 
and the program counter is recorded into a sample file.
