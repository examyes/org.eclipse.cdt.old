<h2>Viewing sample information</h2>

<p>To view the samples collected in given symbol (if symbol information exists
in an executable), expand the desired symbol in the 
<span class="guilabel">System Profile</span> view. 
A list of samples appears. 
Select a sample; the <span class="guilabel">Sample</span> view 
shows the following information about the sample:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <span class="guilabel">VMA</span> (address) of the sample.</li>

<li>The percentage (<span class="guilabel">%age</span>) of the total counts of this executable
collected in this sample's address.</li>

<li>The <span class="guilabel">Line</span> number in the source file of the sample's address 
(only if there is debugging information in the executable).</li>

<li>The source file <span class="guilabel">Name</span> in which this sample's address occurs (only
if there is debugging information in the executable).</li>

</ul>

<p>For any executable with debugging information 
(that is, <span class="guilabel">Line</span> and <span class="guilabel">Name</span> 
are not blank),
double-click the sample in the <span class="guilabel">Sample</span> view to open an editor for the
source file and position the cursor at the given line number.
If the source file is in a CDT project, the project's editor will
open the file; otherwise a generic editor opens the file.</p>
