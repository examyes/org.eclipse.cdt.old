	* SystemProfileView.java (refreshView): Check if kernel module is loaded.
	If not, give user a chance to load it.

2004-07-13  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* SystemProfileView.java (_createActions): IWorkbenchConstants is deprecated.
	 Replace with ActionFactory method.

2004-04-01  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* SystemProfileView.java (_restoreState): Return boolean indicating whether
	any state was actually restored.
	Check whether event exists before adding to display list. This can happen
	when starting up eclipse and the samples have been changed/deleted/moved.
	(createPartControl): If restoring state fails, display first available
	event collected. 

2004-03-30  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>
 
	* SystemProfileView.java (_updateMenus): Create actions for events.
	(refreshView): Call _updateMenus.
	(_createActions): Don't create menu actions here; let _updateMenus do it.

2003-12-25  Keith Seitz <keiths@redhat.com>

	* SystemProfileView.java (createControl): Register with plugin.
	(dispose): Unregister with plugin.
	(_refreshView): Renamed to ...
	(refreshView): ... this.

2003-10-10  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* SystemProfileRootElement.java (_sampleFile): Rename to _container and
	change type to ISampleContainer for better consistency.
	(getChildren): Pass the active workbench window's shell to
	ISampleContainer.getSampleContainers so that a dialog can be displayed
	during this operation.
	(getSampleFile): Removed.
	
	* SystemProfileSession.java (_count): New variable.
	(SystemProfileSession): Delay processing of _getProfileElements...
	(getChildren): ... to here. It was only needed to fill in sample
	counts, and that is now handled when we are constructed (and shortly
	thereafter).
	(hasChildren): Use the sample count to determine if there are children.
	(_getProfileElements): Pass the active workbench window's shell to
	ISampleContainer.getSampleContainers so that a dialog can be displayed
	during this operation.
	(getSampleCount): Return the SampleSession's sample count, which is known
	before _getProfileElements is called.

	* SystemProfileView.java (createPartControl): Don't bother with the huge
	heuristic for figuring out what to display. Just use the first
	SystemProfileEvent in the event list.
	(_refreshEvents): Simply using Oprofile.getSessionEvents.
	(_updateMenus): Don't bother checking whether an event has children
	to enable it. I think this is not necessary.

	* SystemProfileView.java (createPartControl): Don't assume there are events to
	look at.
