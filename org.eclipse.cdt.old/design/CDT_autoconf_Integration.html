<!-- Introduction -->
<div class=section><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></div>
<!--overview-->
<div class=subsection><a name="over">1.1 Overview</a></div>
<br>
<p>
Integrating GNU's Project Management Tools with CDT is aimd to simplify the process of building software packages and 
to make them more portable. By integrating GNUtools, the creation and the maintenance of the files needed to build 
your software has bee eleminated and developers can allocate more time on the software development. 
</p>
<p>
Having this in mind, and the popularity of the GNU project management tools, A decision to integrate 
these tools within CDT has been made. These tools include autoconf, automake, libtool,...etc.
</p>

<!-- Integration Goals -->
<div class=subsection><a name="goals">1.2 Integration Goals</a></div>
<br>
<p>
The goal of integrating GNU tools with CDT is not to merely provide the functionality that these tools 
provide but rather to facilitate and automate the creation of the support files which are needed by the 
GNU project management tools. Among these tools are autoconf, automake, aclocal, autoheader and libtool. 
As an example, autoconf needs an input file called configure.in (autoconf version 2.5 and above, it is 
called configure.ac) while automake needs an input file named Makefile.am file to do their jobs.
</p>
<p>
The focus in this design document is on two tools - autoconf and automake and their requirements. 
Automating and facilitating the creation of the support files for these tools have to be designed 
in a way that is intuitive, simple and to provide the greatest flexibility possible to the developers 
in structuring and managing their projects.
</p>

<!-- Constraints -->
<div class=subsection><a name="const">1.3 Constraints</a></div>
<br>
<p>
Given our objectives, we foresee and acknowledge that the system will be limited in managing imported packages 
that are already configured by GNU management tools. A notification mechanism will be designed to notify the 
user whether the system will be capable of updating and maintaining the imported configuration file or not.
</p>

<!-- System Model- Concepts and Requirements -->
<div class=section><a name="concept">2. System Model- Concepts and Requirements</a></div>

<!-- 2.1 System Description -->
<div class=subsection><a name="desc">2.1 System Description</a></div>
<div class=subsection><a name="back">2.1.1 background</a></div>
<br><b>Autoconf</b>
<p>
Autoconf needs an input file called configure.in. This file can be created manually from scratch or can 
be created with the use of a tool called autoscan. Autoscan creates a file called configure.scan which 
may need to be  manully restructured/shuffled before renaming it to configure.in. You can visit the GNU
website to get more information regarding autoconf. 
</p>
<b>Automake</b>
<p>
Automake - a tool that takes care of creating and maintaing Makefiles - need a file called Makefile.am 
which is created manually by the developer. This file is much more simpler than regular makefiles. 
You can also visit the GNU website and get more information regarding automake.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="setting">2.1.2 Project Management Settings</a></div>
<p>
After the creation of a C/C++ project, users can select to manage the project in the way they prefer. 
CDT shall not enforce certain scenario, but rather the users who select the way hey want to manage 
their project. Users can simply choose to manage the project themselves or to delegate this task to CDT. 
CDT integrates GNU project management tools - autoconf, automake, aclocal, libtool ...-  and it facilitates
the creation/maintenance of the project management files - these files include Makefile.am(s), a 
configure.in which creates the project Makefile(s). 
</p>
<p>
Once the user decides to let CDT manages his/her project, CDT, with the help of template configuration files, 
initializes and updates these files which are needed for autoconf and automake tools to run. These template files 
include configure.in and Makefile.am(s)
</p>
<div class=subsection><a name="flex">2.1.3 Flexibility and Maintenance</a></div>
<p>
Flexibility is needed for the user to customize the package when it is impossible or non practical 
for CDT to provide this kind of customization to the configure script. CDT task then, is to facilitate 
the customization and maintenance processes for the user by providing views and properties that represent 
the configuration files - configure.in and Makefile.am. Users then can update, customize and modify these 
files through these views and property pages.
</p>

<!-- 2.2 Information Structure -->
<div class=subsection><a name="infostruct">2.2 Information Structure</a></div>
<div class=subsection><a name="templates">2.2.1 Project Template files</a></div>
<p>
As mentioned above, CDT initializes and updates the project management template files needed by 
autoconf and automake to create the configure script which then creates the project Makefile(s). 
</p>
<p>
The templates are to be designed to provide the user with the ability to create any types of C/C++ 
applications in the Linux environment. C/C++ applications include terminal, GNOME, KDE, QT,..etc. 
This will depend greatly on the configure.in template file. 
</p>
<p>
Although CDT is maintaining the template files, it provides the user with some flexibility. 
Users are able to modify and add to the template files in the case they need to customize 
their applications.
</p>

<!-- 2.3 Information Flow and Contents -->
<div class=subsection><a name="infoflow">2.3 Information Flow and Contents </a></div>
<div class=subsection><a name="autoflow">2.3.1 Auto Initialization and Updates of Project Configuration Files</a></div>
<br>
<b>Newly Created Project</b>
<p>
Once the user have created a project and decided to let CDT automatically manages the application, 
CDT will insert and initialize the template files in the application workspace. These file are the 
configure.in and Makefile.am files. CDT shall be responsible of updating and maintaining the 
configurations files.
</p>

</center>
<br>
<b>Imported Projects</b>
<p>
In this case the user has imported a project which already has configuration files and wanted the tool 
to manage the project. CDT shall try to classify the configuration files and try to update them accordingly. 
In the case which CDT fails in recognizing these files, a notification shall be sent to the user and CDT 
shall not update the configuration files. It will be the user's responsibility to manage the configuration 
files in this case. 
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="userflow">2.3.2 User Initialization and Updates of Project Configuration Files</a></div>
<p> 
Users will be able to manage the configuration files on their own. CDT to facilitate the users task by providing 
actions, views and property pages where the user can find it easier to manage the configuration files with 
the help of these tools. 
</p>
<p>
CDT recognizes that working with Makefile.am will be easier if there was a view of 
this file. Through this view, users will be able to add/modify to the content of the Makefile.am without 
having deep knowledge about the making of the Makefile.am 
</p>
<center>

</center>
<br>
<div class=subsection><a name="execflow">2.3.3 Execution Flow</a></div>
<p>
After the user has created the configuration files, He/she would be able to build and run the package. 
Once the user invoke the build command, CDT will validate the  configuration files. In the case that 
CDT detects that these files are outdated, CDT will reconfigure the project and then issue a build.

<div class=subsection><a name="autoconf2">3.2.1 Automatic Configuration</a></div>
<div class=subsection><a name="createinit">3.2.1.1 Creation and initialization of autoconf and automake files</a></div>

<p>
Once the user has created / imported a project, and then choose to let CDT manages the project 
using autoconf and automake - the GNU project management tools -, CDT will check the project structure. 
If the project structure is complying with the GNU recommended project structure then CDT will create 
and initialize the project configuration files which are needed to create the configure script. 
</p>

<p>
CDT, by default, shall create and insert - using automake and autoconf - all the auxiliary files in the top level 
(level 1) directory together with the project configure.in (.ac) file and a top level Makefile.am. 
CDT then creates a Makefile.am which then creates a program target in the level 2 directories. 
In any subsequent directory (level 3 and deeper), CDT will create a Makefile.am which then 
creates static library target. CDT shall also provide a mechanism for the user to customize 
this default behavior.
</p>

<p>
In the case that the tool detects that the project structure is not complying with 
GNU recommendations - this is simply means that it will detect source file(s) in the top level 
directory -, CDT will prompt the user to select the type of project target the user wants to create.
</p>
 
<div class=subsection><a name="init">3.2.1.2 Configure.in and Makefil.am Initialization</a></div>
<p> 
CDT shall be responsible of maintaining 2 types of files needed by GNU tools to manage the software package 
currently under development. These files are the configure.in and Makefile.am(s). There is only one 
configure.in per package while there is one Makefile.am in each directory / subdirectory in the project.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="confinit">3.2.1.2.1 Configure.in Initialization</a></div>
<p> 
CDT will initialize configure.in template by providing a package name and version number to it. It will 
also initializes the macro which tells the configure script where to generated Makefile(s) in the project 
directory structure.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="makeinit">3.2.1.2.2 Makefile.am Initializations</a></div>
<p>
CDT shall insert a target Makefile.am in each and every directory in the project directory structure. Then, 
depending on the targets that each Makefile.am represents, CDT shall initialize the variables in each Makefile.am.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="update">3.2.1.3 Configure.in and Makefil.am Updates</a></div>
<p>
CDT shall be responsible of maintaining 2 types of files needed by GNU tools to manage the software package 
currently under development. These files are the configure.in and Makefile.am(s). There is only one configure.in 
per package while there is one Makefile.am in each directory / subdirectory in the project.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="confupdate">3.2.1.3.1 Configure.in Updates</a></div>
<p>
Automatic updates to configure.in will reflect the addition or deletion of project directories. Once a 
directory has been added, configure.in will be updated so that it instructs the configure script to generate 
a new Makefile in this new directory.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="makeupdate">3.2.1.3.2 Makefile.am Updates</a></div>
<p>
CDT will provide automatic updates to the project Makfile.am(s) to reflect the changes of the project 
state while in the development phase. These updates includes adding new Makefile.am as needed. As an 
example is when the user adds a new directory to the project workspace.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="custconf2">3.2.2 Custom configuration</a></div>

<div class=subsection><a name="initconf">3.2.2.1 Creation and initialization of autoconf and automake files</a></div>
<p>
The same as automatic configuration, see section 3.2.1.1 
in addition to the following capabilities 
</p>
<div class=subsection><a name="makeview">3.2.2.1.1 Makefile.am View</a></div>
<p>
Makefile.am view is a visual representation of the Makefile.am and aimed to facilitate the process of customizing 
Makefile.am(s) and hence the project configuration files and the configure script. The goal is to make it easy 
for users that has a minimum knowledge about GNU autoconf and automake tools to do the updates in a simple 
intuitive way.
</p>
<p>
Makefile.am view shall provide actions which will allow the users to manipulate the Makefile.am format. 
Users will be able to switch from a Makefile.am template to another. Users will be able to locate and update 
variables, build and maybe execute the targets they create in the view.
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="ppage">3.2.2.1.2 Project Properly Pages</a></div>
<p>
Through a project property page, users will be able to customize configuration files to suite the course 
of execution. This is an alternate way for the user to customize configuration files. One should mention 
that not all the variables can be defined through the property page, but a subset of it and mainly the set 
that the user most often will work with.
</p>   

<div class=subsection><a name="custinit">3.2.2.2 Configure.in and Makefil.am Initialization</a></div>
<p>
User will be able to customize configure.in and Makefile.am(s).
</p>
<div class=subsection><a name="custupdate">3.2.2.3 Configure.in and Makefil.am Updates</a></div>
<p>
Users will have the choice either to maintain and update the configuration files manually or 
delegate this task to CDT and obviously there will be limitation when going in that route. These 
limitations are addressed in the Constraints section (1.3).
</p>

<div class=subsection><a name="runconf">3.2.3 Running configure</a></div>
<p>
CDT shall provide the user with an action to run the generated  configure script. It will 
also, provide a dialog where the user inputs configure options and arguments.
</p>
<div class=subsection><a name="build">3.2.4 Building C/C++ project</a></div>
<p>
After running the configure script, Makefile(s) will be generated in the proper locations. Users 
then can build, generate and execute project targets. CDT will detect whether the configure script is 
up to date or not. If it is not up to date then CDT will regenerate the configure script before any 
subsequent builds.
