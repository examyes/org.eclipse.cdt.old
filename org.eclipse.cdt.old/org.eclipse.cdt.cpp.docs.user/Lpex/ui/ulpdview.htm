<h3><a name="top"></a>View Pulldown Menu</h3>
<p>Actions and selections in the <strong>View</strong> pulldown menu let you
define how the various parts of the editor and information in those parts is
viewed. Depending on the context of the specific editor window you are working
in, selections in the <strong>View</strong> pulldown menu will include some or
all of the following:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="RefreshFileTree">Refresh file tree</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Updates the directory and file tree information shown in
      the File Selector pane. This action is disabled when showing information
      for open or recently-opened files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="RefreshDriveList">Refresh drive list</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Updates the disk drive and directory information shown in
      the drive selection list at the top of the File Selector pane. This action
      is disabled when showing information for open or recently-opened files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="RemoveDirectoryFromDriveList">Remove
      directory from drive list</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Removes the entry for the directory path displayed in the
      File Selector pane from the drive selection list. This action is enabled
      only for directory paths previously added to the drive selection list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="ReloadFile">Reload file</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Reloads the current file from disk. All changes made since
      the last save of the file are lost.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="RestorePane">Restore pane</a></th>
    <td valign="top">If the currently-selected pane has previously been
      minimized or maximized, this action restores that pane to its previous
      size.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="MaximizePane">Maximize pane</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Maximizes the width of the currently-selected pane so it
      occupies all of the editor window.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="MinimizePane">Minimize pane</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Minimizes the width of the currently-selected pane until
      only the <img src="../images/ngrestr1.gif" width="20" height="14"> restore
      button remains visible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="DetachPane">Detach pane</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Detaches the currently-selected pane from the current
      editor window. The detached pane is placed in its own editor window
      together with only the pulldown menus and menu items that pertain to the
      contents of the now detached pane. The pane remaining in the original
      editor window, if one exists, expands to fill the entire space of that
      editor window and the contents of the pulldown menus change to suit the
      context of the remaining pane.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="ReturnToTheParentPage">Return to the
      parent page</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Appears only in the <strong>View</strong> pulldown menu of
      detached panes. Moves the contents of the current editor window back to
      the editing window from which those contents were originally detached.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="FileSelector">File Selector</a></th>
    <td valign="top">If checked, the left side of current editing window
      displays the File Selector pane. Use this pane to select or open files
      already open in the editor, files recently opened, or any other file
      stored on your system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="Editor">Editor</a></th>
    <td valign="top">If checked, the left side of current editing window
      displays the Editor pane. Use this pane to view and edit the contents of
      files.</td>
