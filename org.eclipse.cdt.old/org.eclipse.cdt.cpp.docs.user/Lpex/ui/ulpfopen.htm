<h3><a name="top"></a>Application Preferences Dialog - File open</h3>
<p>Use the controls in this preference group to specify how new files are opened
and stored by the editor. Controls are:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><em>Sequence numbers</em></td>
    <td valign="top">This group lets you specify the size and location of a
      sequence number area, such as that used with COBOL programs, to be applied
      when files are opened for editing. Sequence numbers are saved along with
      the rest of the file.
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Numbers column</strong></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the starting column for the numeric part of the
          sequence numbers area.
          This field must contain an integer greater than 0.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Numbers width</strong></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the number of character positions occupied by
          the numeric part of the sequence numbers area.
          This field must contain an integer greater than 0 for a
          numeric part in the sequence area to be created.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Text column</strong></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the starting column for the text part of the
          sequence numbers area.
          This field must contain an integer greater than 0.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Text width</strong></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the number of character positions occupied by
          the text part of the sequence numbers area.
          This field must contain an integer greater than 0 for a
          text part in the sequence area to be created.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If both a numeric part and a text part are specified for the
      sequence numbers area, they must be contiguous.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><em>Source encoding</em></td>
    <td valign="top">The editor can work with files originating from or intended
      to be targeted towards a platform, such as an S/390 host system, other
      than that of the workstation on which the editor is running. This group of
      controls lets you specify the character encoding used to represent the
      file being loaded into the editor.
      <p>The current value in the <strong>Source encoding</strong> field is
      initially the name of the native character encoding set used by the
      workstation on which the editor is running. You can change this to another
      character encoding set by double-clicking on the choices provided in the
      selection list below the <strong>Source encoding</strong> field, or by
      directly typing in the name of the character encoding set.</p>
