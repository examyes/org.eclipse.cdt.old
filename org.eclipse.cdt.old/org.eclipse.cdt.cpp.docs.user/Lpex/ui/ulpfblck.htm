<h3><a name="top"></a>Application Preferences Dialog - Block</h3>
<p>Use the selection list in this preference group to specify the default text
selection mode for the editor.</p>
<p>Blocks of text selected with a blocking type other than <strong>stream</strong>
are detached from the location of the cursor. Moving the cursor to another part
of your file does not deselect text selected with these actions.</p>
<p>Available blocking types in the <strong>Default block type</strong> selection
list are:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><strong>character</strong></th>
    <td valign="top">Text is selected on a character to character basis. This
      blocking method is similar to stream mode, except that the selected block
      is detached from the position of the cursor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><strong>element</strong></th>
    <td valign="top">Only complete lines of text can be selected. The selected
      block is detached from the position of the cursor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><strong>rectangle</strong></th>
    <td valign="top">Lets you select rectangular areas of text in the mid-part
      of a line or group of lines. The selected block is detached from the
      position of the cursor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><strong>stream</strong></th>
    <td valign="top">This is the selection mode commonly used in most text
      editors and word processors. Text is selected on a character to character
      basis. Unlike the other blocking modes, the cursor cannot be moved to
      another part of the file without deselecting a block of selected text.
      Once text is selected, the next keyboard action will usually affect the
      entire selection of text. For example, pressing a keyboard character will
      replace the entire selected text with that character, and pressing the <strong>Delete</strong>
      key will remove the entire selected block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><em>Push buttons</em></td>
    <td valign="top">
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Apply</strong></dt>
        <dd>Applies current selections to the editor and leaves the Application
          Preferences dialog open.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Reset</strong></dt>
        <dd>Cancels current selections and leaves the Application Preferences
          dialog open.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Default</strong></dt>
        <dd>Restores default editor settings to options in this pane.</dd>
