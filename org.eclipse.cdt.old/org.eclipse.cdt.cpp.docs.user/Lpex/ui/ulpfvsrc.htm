<h3><a name="top"></a>Application Preferences Dialog - Source encoding (for
named file)</h3>
<p>Use the controls in this preference group to specify how the editor opens and
stores the contents of a specific file. Controls are:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><em>Source encoding</em></td>
    <td valign="top">The editor can work with files originating from or intended
      to be targeted towards a platform, such as an S/390 host system, other
      than that of the workstation on which the editor is running. This group of
      controls lets you specify the character encoding used to represent the
      file being loaded into the editor.
      <p>The current value in the <strong>Source encoding</strong> field is
      initially the name of the native character encoding set used by the
      workstation on which the editor is running. You can change this to another
      character encoding set by double-clicking on the choices provided in the
      selection list below the <strong>Source encoding</strong> field, or by
      directly typing in the name of the character encoding set.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

    <td valign="top">

          dialog open.</dd>
