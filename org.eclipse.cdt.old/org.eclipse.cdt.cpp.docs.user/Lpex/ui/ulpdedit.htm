<h3><a name="top"></a>Edit Pulldown Menu</h3>
<p>The <strong>Edit</strong> pulldown menu gives access to basic file
operations. Default selections in the <strong>Edit</strong> pulldown menu and
their corresponding actions are:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="Undo">Undo</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Undoes the last set of changes made to the current file.
      <p>This menu choice is available only when one or more sets of undoable
      changes exists. If several sets of changes have been done to the file, the
      <strong>Undo</strong> choice will undo those changes one at a time,
      starting with the most recent set of changes.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left" valign="top"><a name="Redo">Redo</a></th>
    <td valign="top">Redoes a previously-undone set of changes to the current
      file. This menu choice is available only when one or more sets of redoable
      changes exists. If several sets of changes to a file have been undone, the

          clipboard.</li>
        <li>If you paste text into a file that has a record length shorter than
          that of the text in the clipboard, the text may be truncated when you
          save the file back to its host. You will be warned that the file's
