<h3><a name="top"></a>Introducing the editor</h3>

<p>The editor can be used to create and edit many kinds
of files, including program source files, documentation, and data
files. </p>

<p>In addition to basic editing functions, the editor offers
the following features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Language parsing uses automatic indenting, color, and
        text effects to emphasize different parts of your source
        program, such as programming language keywords, logic
        structures, and comment lines.</li>
    <li>Location marking facilities let you define bookmarks
        that let you move quickly from one location to another
        within your document.</li>
    <li>Elaborate search facilities let you specify the precise
        scope of the search.&nbsp; In addition to locating specific
        character strings, other search facilities let you find
        specific locations within your document.</li>
    <li>Multiple editing windows let you have more than one document
        open for editing at a time. </li>
    <li>Multiple editing views let you open multiple views of
        the same document for editing, letting you view different
        parts of the document at the same time.&nbsp; Changes to a document in
        any one view are also reflected in the other views of
        that same document.</li>
    <li>Keystroke recording facilities let you record
        sets of keystrokes to replay later.</li>
</ul>
