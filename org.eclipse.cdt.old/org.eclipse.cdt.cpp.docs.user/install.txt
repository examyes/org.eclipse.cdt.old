This document describes how to install\upgrade the C/C++ Development Toolkit.

Upgrading
---------

If you have a previous version of the CDT installed, you should remove it before
installing the 20020116 driver.  To do this, remove the CDT plugins from your 
eclipse/plugins directory if you are sure that you have not installed any other
plugins whose names begin with "com.ibm".  

		rm -rf <some_dir>/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm*

If you have installed some other plugins whose names may also start with 
"com.ibm", or if you are not sure, then only delete the following plugins:

org.eclipse.cdt.cpp.docs.user
org.eclipse.cdt.cpp.miners
org.eclipse.cdt.cpp.miners.parser
org.eclipse.cdt.cpp.ui
com.ibm.debug
com.ibm.debug.doc.user
org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbPicl
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.core
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.extra
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.extra.server
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.hosts
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.miners
org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.ui
com.ibm.linux.help
com.ibm.lpex

We will be providing an installer that will take care of this for you in future 
releases.

NOTE:

Since eclipse persists UI information, and fields or view names may have changed,
it may be necessary to remove the metadata for the CDT plugins.  If you find 
some runtime exceptions from one of the above plugins, or plugins not being 
loaded try the following:

1. From a shell, navigate to where you invoke eclipse from.
2. There should be a ".metadata" or "workspace" directory there.
3. Navigate down to the workspace/.metadata/.plugins directory.
4. Remove any directories that match the plugin names above.
   If after trying this and restarting eclipse, the problems still exist, 
   You can try removing the entire ".metadata" directory.  If the problems 
   still exist then open a bug at http://bugs.eclipse.org



Installation
------------
To install the plugin for regular use, simply unzip cdt-eclipse-20020116-local.zip 
into the eclipse/plugins directory:
     unzip cdt-eclipse-20020116-local.zip -d <...>/eclipse/plugins
Once you have unzipped the CDT plugins into the eclipse/plugins directory,
the CDT should be ready for use.

To work with remote projects, you will need to install cdt-eclipse-20020116-server.zip
on the remote machine.  Refer to org.eclipse.cdt.cpp.docs.user/tasks/remote/server.htm
for details.


Building
--------

To generate a build environment (which is not necessary to run the CDT) for the CDT 
plugins, perform the following:
 1. Ensure that the cdt-eclipse-20020116-local.zip has been unzipped in your 
    eclipse/plugins directory
 2. Goto the .../eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.cdt.dstore.core directory
 3. Type make dev

Instructions will be provided later for working with CDT as Eclipse Plugin 
Development Environment (PDE) projects.
