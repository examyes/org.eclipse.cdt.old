This document describes how to install the C/C++ Development Toolkit.


To install the plugin for regular use, simply unzip cdt-eclipse-0.5.0-local.zip 
into the eclipse/plugins directory:
     unzip cdt-eclipse-0.5.0-local.zip -d <...>/eclipse/plugins
Once you have unzipped the CDT plugins into the eclipse/plugins directory,
the CDT should be ready for use.

To work with remote projects, you will need to install cdt-eclipse-0.5.0-server.zip
on the remote machine.  Refer to com.ibm.cpp.docs.user/tasks/remote/server.htm
for details.



Note: to generate a build environment for the CDT plugins, perform the following:
 1. Ensure that the cdt-eclipse-0.5.0-local.zip has been unzipped in your eclipse/plugins directory
 2. Goto the .../eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.dstore.core directory
 3. Type make dev

Instructions will be provided later for working with CDT as Eclipse Plugin 
Development Environment (PDE) projects.
