# Views

context_desc_dbg_register_view				=	The Registers view allows you to view \
								the contents of the registers monitored for your \
								program. Initially, registers are displayed by register \
								groups. These register groups can be expanded to display \
								a register that you wish to examine or edit.\n\n\
								In the Registers view, floating-point registers are \
								displayed either as floating-point decimal numbers or as \
								hexadecimal values.
context_desc_dbg_monitor_view				=	The Monitors view displays variables and expressions that \
								you have selected to monitor. You can select the variables \
								or expressions from the Editor.\n\n\
								Use the Monitors view to monitor global variables or \
								variables you want to see at all times during your debugging \
								session. From the Monitors view, you can also modify the \
								content of variables or change the representation of values.
context_desc_dbg_modules_view				=	The Modules view displays a list of modules loaded while \
								running your program. The items in the list can be expanded \
								to show compile units, files and functions.
context_desc_dbg_storage_view				=	The Storage view lets you view and change the contents of \
								storage areas used by your program. You can also change the \
								address range to view and modify the contents of storage.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Actions
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

context_desc_dbg_edit_value_action			=	Select this menu item to be able to edit the value that you \
								have selected. Alternatively, you may double-click on the \
								value to edit it.
context_desc_dbg_change_representation_action		=	Select your preferred representation (Decimal or \
								Hexadecimal) for monitor contents.
context_desc_dbg_copy_view_to_clipboard_action		=	Select this button to copy the view to your system clipboard. \
								The view is copied so that expanded nodes display node \
								contents and the contents of collapsed nodes are not copied.
context_desc_dbg_disable_storage_monitor_action		=	Select this menu item to disable the monitoring of a \
								variable or expression in this view. The advantage \
								of disabling a monitored expression instead of deleting it is \
								that it is easier to enable a monitored expression than to \
								recreate it.
context_desc_dbg_disable_variable_monitor_action	=	Select this menu item to disable the monitoring of a \
								variable or expression in this view. The \
								advantage of disabling a monitored expression instead of \
								deleting it is that it is easier to enable a monitored \
								expression than to recreate it.
context_desc_dbg_monitor_expression_action		=	Select this to invoke the Monitor Expression dialog box, in \
								which you can set a variable or expression to be \
								monitored in the Monitors or Storage view.
context_desc_dbg_print_view_action			=	Select this button to print this view. The view is printed so \
								that expanded nodes display node contents and the contents of \
								collapsed nodes are not printed.
context_desc_dbg_remove_storage_monitor_action		=	Select this to remove the monitoring of the variable or \
								expression in this view.
context_desc_dbg_remove_variable_from_monitor_action	=	Select this to remove the monitoring of the variable in this \
								view.

								monitoring, select this to return to the address.
# Actions set in plugin.xml
context_desc_dbg_add_entry				=	This will launch a dialog that allows you to set a new \
								breakpoint that stops program execution when the start of a \
								function, method, or entry point is encountered.
context_desc_dbg_add_address				=	This will launch a dialog that allows you to set a new \
								breakpoint that stops program execution when a specific \
								address is reached in your executable.
context_desc_dbg_add_watch				=	This will launch a dialog that allows you to set a new \
								breakpoint that causes program execution to stop whenever \
								the class field being watched is modified. Program execution \
								stops even if the new value for the field is the same as the \
								old value.
context_desc_dbg_add_load				=	This will launch a dialog that allows you to set a new \
								breakpoint that stops program execution when a specified DLL, \
								dynamically called routine, or program loads.
context_desc_dbg_edit_breakpoint_action			=	This will re-launch the wizard by which this breakpoint was \
								created, allowing you to edit entries in the wizard.
context_picl_load_launcher				=	Choose this to launch and debug a compiled application.
context_desc_dbg_add_register_storage_monitor_action	=	Select this to add the selected register to a Storage monitor \
								in the Storage view.
context_desc_dbg_add_register_monitor_action		=	Select this to add the selected register to the Monitors view.

# Dialogs
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

context_desc_dbg_add_exception_dialog			=	Use this dialog to specify the types of exceptions or the \
								exception level that you want the Debugger to recognize in \
								the loaded program. To specify an exception or exception \
								level, select the checkbox to the left of it.\n\n\
								You can narrow down the list of available exceptions by \
								making filter entries in the search field. If you have \
								hidden selected exceptions by using search and hit OK, the \
								debugger will recognize all selected exceptions (those \
								selected when filtering and those hidden during a search).
context_desc_dbg_fork_dialog				=	A fork() call has been encountered. Use this dialog to \
								specify the process to debug when the debugger encounters \
								a fork() call. The debugger will halt inside the fork() \
								runtime function, where the call to the kernel is made.
context_desc_dbg_exception_dialog			=	An exception that matches one of the exceptions specified \
								when setting a compiled language exception breakpoint has \
								occurred.
context_desc_dbg_new_process_dialog			=	A new process has been created as the result of an exec() \
								function call in the program you are debugging. While in \
								this dialog, you can choose to debug program initialization. \
								When you close the dialog box, you will be debugging the \
								new process rather than the calling process.
context_desc_dbg_overloaded_dialog			=	Select the function or entry point that you want to find.
context_desc_dbg_monitor_expression_dialog		=	Use this dialog to specify an expression that you would \
								like to add to the Monitors or Storage view.

								editor to source view or disassembly view.
