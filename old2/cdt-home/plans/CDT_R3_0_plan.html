<h1>CDT Project<br>
  3.0 Plan</h1>
<p>Initial Document December 20, 2004, updated Feb 15, 2005<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:dev-cdt-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer mailing list.</i></p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release 
  of CDT after 2.1, designated release 3.0 
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Target operating environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Platform">CDT subprojects (if applicable)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, we (the CDT Project) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
throughout the release cycle.

<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;

<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the CDT Project.
 Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
CDT. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.

<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to
several components; other may pervade the entire CDT Project. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in
no particular order.

<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. All interesting feature work is accounted for in
this plan.

<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that someone in 
  the CDT opensource community has decided 
    to address for the release (includes development, testing, and 
  documentation).</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed, deferred, or rejected.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but judged
    unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary
    of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating
    the discussion.</li>
  <li><b>No Committment</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but no 
  volunteers have agreed to produce this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables: 
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for CDT Project, available as versions tagged 
      &quot;CDT_30&quot; 
    in the CDT Project <a href="http://dev.cdt.org/viewcvs/">CVS repository</a>.</li>
  <li> CDT Project (downloadable zips and update site) -- source + binary 
  distribution, used to develop on, or extend the CDT</li>
  <li>CDT runtime binary distribution (downloadable zips and update site) -- the 
  stuff needed to run CDT</li>
  <li>CDT Test Plugins (downloadable zips and update site) -- All the JUnit and 
  test infrastructure need to run the automated CDT tests</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestone occurring at regular intervals (~6 weeks) exist to facilitate 
  coarse-grained planning and staging. 

<br><b>Synchronization Expectations</b><br>

Once an Eclipse platform 3.1 milestone build is released, it will be vetted for 
use by a subset of the CDT development team.  Once approved as stable, all CDT 
3.0 development must move to that release of the Eclipse platform.

Once a CDT milestone build is complete, developers performing large scale 
CDT integration will be expected to move forward to using that build for
development.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the CDT milestone
builds are stable platforms for performing CDT integration, though perhaps 
not suitable for large scale C/C++ development.

<p>The milestones are:
<ul>
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 M5 Feb 18,2005</i>
 <li>Friday Mar. 14, 2005 - CDT 3.0 M5 - stable build reflecting progress
 </ul>
<ul>
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 M6 Apr 1, 2005</i>
 <li>Friday April 11, 2005 - CDT 3.0 M6 - stable build reflecting progress, APIs are documented
</ul>
<ul>
	<i>Eclipse 3.1 M7 May 13, stable build - feature complete - development freeze lock down and testing begins</i>
	<li>Monday, May 30, 2005 - CDT 3.0 M7  - stable build, feature complete, APIs frozen. This is considered RC0. 
	Lock down and external testing begins with M7 and progresses through a series of test-fix phases against candidate
	releases. Focus on clearing bug backlog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Release candidate builds are planned as follows (M7 is RC0):

<ul>
 <i>Note these dates are conditional on Eclipse 3.1 schedule</i>
 <li>CDT 3.0 RC1 Monday,  June 13,2005 - Release Candidate</li>
 <li>CDT 3.0 RC2 Monday, June 27, 2005 - Release Candidate </li> 
</ul>
<ul> 
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 GA expected ~July 1</i>
 <li>Wednesday Jul. 13, 2005 - Release Candate 4 (3.0 RC4)</li>  
</ul>


<p> Depending on the circumstances, and on the stability of Eclipse 3.1, we may add 
  additional release candidate builds 
  or fine-tune the schedule. The 3.0 release is targeted for the week of July 
  13, 2005. All release deliverables will be available for download as soon as 
  the release has been tested and validated in the target operating configurations 
  listed below.</p>


<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.0 with 2.1</h3>

<p>CDT will be forward compatible with CDT 2.1. 
  The nature and scope of some of the key plan items are such that the only feasible 
  solutions would break compatibility. Since breaking 
  changes are a disruption to the CDT community they cannot be taken lightly. 
  We will have an open discussion with the community before approving a proposed 
  breaking change for inclusion in 3.0. We aim to minimize the effort required 
  to port an existing product to the 3.0 APIs. We will provide a comprehensive 
  <a href="http://???"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting Guide</em></a> that covers the areas 
  of breaking API changes, and describes how to port existing 2.1 extensions to 
  3.0. Up-to-date drafts of the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_0_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>CDT 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em></a> will be included with milestone builds so that it's 
  possible to climb aboard the 3.0 release wagon at the early stages, or to estimate 
  the amount of effort that will be involved in eventually porting existing extensions 
  to 3.0.</p>

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with CDT 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="???"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting 
  Guide</em></a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need 
  to be ported to CDT 3.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility is not supported. 
  There is no guarantee that compliance with CDT 3.0 APIs would ensure compliance 
  with CDT 2.1 APIs. Refer to general Eclipse document on Evolving APIs
  for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain contract compatibility.</p>

<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards binary-compatible 
  with CDT 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="????"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting 
  Guide</em></a>. CDT 3.0 will include additional runtime compatibility mechanisms 
  to provide effective binary API compatibility. Downward plug-in compatibility 
  is not supported. Plug-ins/Extensions for CDT 3.0 will not be usable in CDT 
  2.1. Refer to <i><a href="?????">Evolving CDT APIs</a></i> for a discussion 
  of the kinds of API changes that maintain binary compatibility. 

<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards source-compatible with 
  Eclipse SDK 3.1 except in the areas noted in the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_0_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>CDT 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em></a>.

<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Workspaces containing CDT 2.0 and CDT 2.1 projects
  will be forward migrated.

<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the CDT API are inherently unsupportable and 
  receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier releases.

<h2><a name="Platform">CDT Project</a> Themes &amp; Priorities</h2>
<p> Plan items reflect new features of CDT, or areas where existing features will 
  be significantly reworked. Many of the changes under consideration for the next 
  release of the CDT address two (2) major themes. Since each theme has 
  a number of items, the committed, proposed, and deferred plan items are grouped 
  in sections by theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#ThemePerformance">Theme 1: Performance and Scalability</a>  - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT more reactive.</li>

  <li><a href="#ThemeParserCorrectness">Theme 2: Parser Correctness</a>  - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT parser more accurate and complete.</li>
  
  <li><a href="#ThemeAST">Theme 3: AST/DOM</a>  - 
  Work focusing on producing an Abstract syntax tree/DOM for C++.</li>
  
  <li><a href="#ThemeUserExperience">Theme 4: User Experience</a> - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT easier to use.</li>
  
  <li><a href="#ThemeManagedBuild">Theme 5: Managed Build Extensions</a> - 
  Work on extending the CDT managed build system.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, there are important CDT improvements that do not naturally fit 
  into any of the above themes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#OtherPlatform">Other CDT items</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ThemePerformance">Theme 1: Performance and Scalability</a></h3>

<p>Working with C/C++ source offers a number of unique challenges.  Work is 
underway to improve the scalability of the underlying source code model
to provide more rapid responses (for searching and cross referencing) and 
more accurate results (for refactoring and outlining).</p>

We will add the ability to allow the index generation to be customized.&nbsp; 
One initial example will be the addition of a ctags indexer (which will not be 
as functional as the internal parser based indexer).&nbsp; We will also be 
restructuring the contents of the index to provide more and &quot;cheaper&quot; 
information to the index clients.&nbsp;

overrides less specific (e.g. configuration takes precedence over
workspace). User defined values override tool-chain defined values which
override built-in values at the same scope.

<p><b>Environment variables</b>
Allow tool-chains to define additional environment variables and values
at configuration and project scope.  This includes being able to set the
executable, include and library paths, so that the user is not required
to set the environment before starting Eclipse.  Users can define
additional variables and values at configuration, project, and workspace
scope.  More specific scope overrides less specific (e.g. configuration
takes precedence over workspace).  User defined values override
tool-chain defined values which override built-in values at the same
scope.  Environment variables are passed to the build process and can be
used as build macros.

<p><b>Custom build steps (command line scripts)</b>
Add support for Pre & Post build command scripts.  Allow a user to
define a set of commands to be run on all files with a specified
extension(s).  This is a simple tool integration method that could be
used with tools such as lex and yacc.  Allow a user to define a set of
commands to be used to build a specific source file.

<p><b>Custom file extensions</b>
Allow the user to modify the default file extensions that map to a tool.
CDT already has the C/C++ File Types property page.  MBS will use that
information.  MBS would also like to extend that page to allow
tool-integrators to define "file-types" and default extensions for any
tool that they want to integrate into their tool chain - for example,
lex, yacc, or a Fortran compiler.

<p><b>Tool Input ordering</b>
Allow the user to specify the order for input files for tools that
accept multiple files (e.g. Linker).

<p><b>Option enhancements:</b>
Add an extension callback for option "applicability".  This would allow
a tool-chain to specify whether or not an option is currently displayed,
enabled, and used in command-line generation.
Support the browseType attribute for String properties by displaying a
file selection dialog box.

<pre>Core
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Error Parser: The current error parser is limited,
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; and there is no clean way to maintain contexts for
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; multiline errors matching.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* new Interface been proposed(PR 54812)
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* new feature: hyperlinking (PR 50124)

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Resolver Model: The current file mappings/associations
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; are standalone to CDT, the resolver needs to propagate
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; the information to the Eclipse platform.&nbsp; This can now
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; be done with the new IContentTypeManager and extension
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; points in Eclipse-3.1 (PR 78821 ..).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- IPathEntry interface changes: The scanner automatic discovery
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; is now more powerfull and can return information on per file basis.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; The interface of the IPathEntry needs to be change to accomodate (PR 72821).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Variable substitution: A service offered by the Core Model to mantain
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; variables specific to the CDT, those variables could be exported (PR 79518).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UI
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Overhaul of the OpenType, Type Hierarchy and C/C++ browsing views: The
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenType was doing a very agressive caching, with the new features provided
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; by the indexer(providing offset locations) we can scale down the process and
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; rely more on the indexer (PR 48213, ...).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Generate overriding methods in the CEditor, for C++ classes (PR 58932)

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Class Wizard
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* generate user customizable define guards (PR 75153)
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* use documentation templates(PR 56207)

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- More Drag && Drop support, in the views (PR 83112, ..).
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- C/C++ Editor improvements:
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* coloring of operators, braces and numbers,
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* outline in selectable dialog (Ctrl O) with search input(PR 83112).
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* Preference Pages changes to match Eclipse-3.1 policies(Many settings
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;&nbsp; are now common on the Workbench/Text Editor).
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Removing of the old Template scheme to match Eclipse-3.1 (PR 71111).
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Definition/Declaration view, showing the definition of a symbol(relies
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; on the indexer.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Open call hierarchy view.


  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make Builder
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- Make targets
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* Allow setting environment for build targets(PR 47241)
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;		&nbsp;* Allow variables substitution in arguments(PR 48009).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Launch
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;- New launch configuration, gdbserver.&nbsp; Currently the
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; gdb server launch is tied to the local launcher,
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp; confusing the user(PR 79458)
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 		&nbsp;&nbsp;
