<h1>CDT Project<br>
  3.0 Plan (Draft template)</h1>
<p>Initial Document December 20, 2004 <br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:dev-cdt-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer mailing list.</i></p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release 
  of CDT after 2.1, designated release 3.0 
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Target operating environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Platform">CDT subprojects (if applicable)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, we (the CDT Project) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
throughout the release cycle.

<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;

<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the CDT Project.
 Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
CDT. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.

<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to
several components; other may pervade the entire CDT Project. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in
no particular order.

<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. All interesting feature work is accounted for in
this plan.

<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have decided 
    to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed, deferred, or rejected.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but judged
    unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary
    of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating
    the discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables: 
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for CDT Project, available as versions tagged 
      &quot;CDT_30&quot; 
    in the CDT Project <a href="http://dev.cdt.org/viewcvs/">CVS repository</a>.</li>
  <li> CDT Project (downloadable).</li>
  <li>CDT runtime binary distribution (downloadable).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestone occurring at regular intervals (~4 weeks) exist to facilitate 
  coarse-grained planning and staging. 

<br><b>Synchronization Expectations</b><br>

Once an Eclipse platform 3.1 milestone build is released, it will be vetted for 
use by a subset of the CDT development team.  Once approved as stable, all CDT 
3.0 development must move to that release of the Eclipse platform.

Once a CDT milestone build is complete, developers performing large scale 
CDT integration will be expected to move forward to using that build for
development.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the CDT milestone
builds are stable platforms for performing CDT integration, though perhaps 
not suitable for large scale C/C++ development.

<p>The milestones are:
<ul>
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 M4 based builds</i>
 <li>Friday Jan. 7,2005 - Milestone 1 (3.0 M1) - initial tool and process spin up
 <li>Friday Feb. 4,2005 - Milestone 2 (3.0 M2) - stable build reflecting progress
</ul>
<ul>
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 M5 Feb 18,2005</i>
 <li>Friday Mar. 4,2005 - Milestone 3 (3.0 M3) - stable build reflecting progress
 <li>Friday Apr. 1,2005 - Milestone 4 (3.0 M4) - initial API freeze for breaking changes
</ul>
<ul>
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 M6 Apr 1, 2005</i>
 <li>Friday May  6,2005 - Milestone 5 (3.0 M5) - API freeze, stable build focus on clearing
                                             bug backlog
 <li>Friday Jun. 3,2005 - Milestone 6 (3.0 M6) - stable build, feature complete, RC0
</ul>

<p>Lock down and external testing begins with M6 and progresses through a series of 
test-fix phases against candidate releases.  Release candidate builds are planned
as follows (M6 is RC0)</p>

<ul>
 <i>Note these dates are conditional on Eclipse 3.1 schedule</i>

 <li>Wednesday Jun. 15,2005 - Release Candidate 1 (3.0 RC1)
 <li>Friday Jun. 24, 2005 - Release Candidate 2 (3.0 RC2)
 <li>Friday Jul. 1, 2005 - Release Candidate 3 (3.0 RC3)
</ul>
<ul> 
 <i>Eclipse 3.1 GA expected ~July 1
</i>

 <li>Wednesday Jul. 13, 2005 - Release Candate 4 (3.0 RC4) 
</ul>

<p> Depending on the circumstances, and on the stability of Eclipse 3.1, we may add 
  additional release candidate builds 
  or fine-tune the schedule. The 3.0 release is targeted for the week of July 
  13, 2005. All release deliverables will be available for download as soon as 
  the release has been tested and validated in the target operating configurations 
  listed below.</p>


<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.0 with 2.1</h3>

<p>CDT will be forward compatible with CDT 2.1. 
  The nature and scope of some of the key plan items are such that the only feasible 
  solutions would break compatibility. Since breaking 
  changes are a disruption to the CDT community they cannot be taken lightly. 
  We will have an open discussion with the community before approving a proposed 
  breaking change for inclusion in 3.0. We aim to minimize the effort required 
  to port an existing product to the 3.0 APIs. We will provide a comprehensive 
  <a href="http://???"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting Guide</em></a> that covers the areas 
  of breaking API changes, and describes how to port existing 2.1 extensions to 
  3.0. Up-to-date drafts of the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_0_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>CDT 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em></a> will be included with milestone builds so that it's 
  possible to climb aboard the 3.0 release wagon at the early stages, or to estimate 
  the amount of effort that will be involved in eventually porting existing extensions 
  to 3.0.</p>

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with CDT 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="???"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting 
  Guide</em></a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need 
  to be ported to CDT 3.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility is not supported. 
  There is no guarantee that compliance with CDT 3.0 APIs would ensure compliance 
  with CDT 2.1 APIs. Refer to general Eclipse document on Evolving APIs
  for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain contract compatibility.</p>

<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards binary-compatible 
  with CDT 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="????"><em>CDT 3.0 Porting 
  Guide</em></a>. CDT 3.0 will include additional runtime compatibility mechanisms 
  to provide effective binary API compatibility. Downward plug-in compatibility 
  is not supported. Plug-ins/Extensions for CDT 3.0 will not be usable in CDT 
  2.1. Refer to <i><a href="?????">Evolving CDT APIs</a></i> for a discussion 
  of the kinds of API changes that maintain binary compatibility. 

<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> CDT 3.0 will be upwards source-compatible with 
  Eclipse SDK 3.1 except in the areas noted in the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_0_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>CDT 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em></a>.

<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Workspaces containing CDT 2.0 and CDT 2.1 projects
  will be forward migrated.

<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the CDT API are inherently unsupportable and 
  receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier releases.

<h2><a name="Platform">CDT Project</a> Themes &amp; Priorities</h2>
<p> Plan items reflect new features of CDT, or areas where existing features will 
  be significantly reworked. Many of the changes under consideration for the next 
  release of the CDT address two (2) major themes. Since each theme has 
  a number of items, the committed, proposed, and deferred plan items are grouped 
  in sections by theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#ThemePerformance">Theme 1: Performance and Scalability</a>  - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT more reactive.</li>

  <li><a href="#ThemeParserCorrectness">Theme 2: Parser Correctness</a>  - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT parser more accurate and complete.</li>
  
  <li><a href="#ThemeAST">Theme 3: AST/DOM</a>  - 
  Work focusing on producing an Abstract syntax tree/DOM for C++.</li>
  
  <li><a href="#ThemeUserExperience">Theme 4: User Experience</a> - 
  Work focusing on making the CDT easier to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are important CDT improvements that do not naturally fit 
  into any of the above themes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#OtherPlatform">Other CDT items</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ThemePerformance">Theme 1: Performance and Scalability</a></h3>

<p>Working with C/C++ source offers a number of unique challenges.  Work is 
underway to improve the scalability of the underlying source code model
to provide more rapid responses (for searching and cross referencing) and 
more accurate results (for refactoring and outlining).</p>

One initial example will be the addition of a ctags indexer (which will not be
