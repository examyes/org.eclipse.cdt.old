<h1>
C/C++ Development Tools - CDT Project<br>
R1.0 Plan</h1>
<font color="green">Last revised February 27, 2002</font>
<br>First edition January 23, 2002<br>
This document lays out the plan for the next major release of the C/C++
Development Tools (CDT) Project, designated release 1.0. The main emphasis
of the 1.0 release will be to deliver features judged to be required for
a 1.0 release and on improving quality (bug fixing and more complete test
coverage).&nbsp; <b>Note that the CDT 1.0 release will only run on Eclipse
R1.0.</b>
<p>This plan serves as an important input to the planning processes of
the various customers of the CDT Project. It tells them what to expect
(or what not to expect) in the next release so that they can plan their
projects accordingly.
<p>Plans are rarely completely unchanging over the life cycle of a release,
and this project is no exception. We will update this document as required
to reflect any changes to the 1.0 release plan. We reserve the right to
add items to this list. The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html" target="_top">developer
mailing list archives</a> contain further, in-depth information about how
a component is changing. Particular problem reports being worked on for
the 1.0 release can be tracked through the Eclipse <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">bug
database</a>; the "Target Milestone" field reflects when a work item will
become available in the main development stream.
<h2>

<h2>
Compatibility with Previous Release</h2>

<p><br><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> CDT 1.0 will be upwards contract
compatible with CDT 0.5 unless noted. This means that programs in full
compliance with contracts specified in the CDT 0.5 APIs will automatically
be in full compliance with the CDT 1.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with the CDT 1.0
APIs would ensure compliance with the CDT 0.5 APIs.
<h2>
Work Items</h2>
Note that fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation, examples,
etc. are considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not
included in this plan unless they would also involve significant changes
to the plugin.
<p>The following committed items reflect new features of CDT, or areas
where existing features will be significantly reworked.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> General</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Reduce memory footprint for Java builder"></a><b>Standalone
Installer.&nbsp; </b>A simple standalone graphical installer will be provided
that removes any existing CDT installations, and installs the new version.&nbsp;
It will also provide some options, such as unzipping the source for each
plugin, building each plugin, and perhaps using ftp to put the server pieces
on a remote machine and run them.
<p><a NAME="Improve Java search"></a><b>Support for appending environment
variables.&nbsp; </b>Support will be added to allow a Project's Environment
to properly override any system environment variables using variable references
(such as $PATH, or ${FOO}, or %BAR%)
<p><a NAME="Improve code assist"></a><b>org.eclipse rename.&nbsp; </b>All
plugins shipped with CDT except for LPEX and the debugger will have their
package prefix names changed from <i>com.ibm</i> to <i>org.eclipse.</i>
<p><a NAME="Upgrade Eclipse Java compiler to be compliant with version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform"></a><b>Network
failure diagnose and report.&nbsp; </b>In the event of a network failure,
when users are working with remote projects, the connection is gracefully
terminated and a message reports the occurrence.
<p><a NAME="Improve build classpath"></a><b>Customizable command specification
in menu.&nbsp; </b>In the C/C++ Projects view, context sensitive menus
display a submenu for "Command Specifications".&nbsp; The submenu is populated
with menu actions for launching each of the command specifications that
were defined in the "Command Specifications" view.
<p><a NAME="Improve accessibility - JDT"></a><b>Browse toolbar actions
for declarations views.&nbsp; </b>The Project Objects, System Objects,
and Parse Files views have toolbar items with actions that facilitate view
browsing with history by changing the input to the corresponding view.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "home" toolbar item navigates to the default view input, the "back"
toolbar item browses back in the history, the "forward" toolbar item browses
forward in the history and the "step into" toolbar item browses into the
selected object.
<font color="green">
<p><a NAME="Standard Input Stupport"></a><b>Standard Input Support In Output View&nbsp;</b> Allow users to interact with programs in the Output View.
</font>
<p><a NAME="Improve Java editor"></a><b>New icon set.&nbsp;</b> A standard
set of plugin icons more consistent with existing Eclipse icons will replace
those that are currently used.&nbsp; The label provider that accessed icons
based on their name changes to use defined mappings between names and icons.
<p><a NAME="Improve refactoring"></a><b>Byte transfer from client to server.
</b>A
new set of DataStore APIs is added to facilitate transfer of client files
to a server.&nbsp; These APIs allow the transfer of variable sized sets
of bytes to the remote side and appending to existing remote files.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Autoconf</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve refactoring"></a><b>Enable/Disable advanced
autoconf actions.&nbsp; </b>Based on the Target type in each Makefile.am
and the location of the Makefile.am some of the actions&nbsp; will be disabled/enabled.&nbsp;
As an example: The "Create Program Makefile.am" will be disabled if the
Makefile.am in this directory is in fact of type Programs Makefile.am.&nbsp;
Another example is the action Create TopLevel Makefile.am will be enabled
only for the top level directory.
<p><a NAME="Facilitate string externalization"></a><b>On/Off automatic
autoconf .am update.&nbsp; </b>A feature that lets the user decide whether
or not to let the system automatically update dependencies between Makefile.am's.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other alternative is the user manually maintains all Makefile.am's.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C/C++ Parser</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Allow runtime classpath to the configured"></a><b>Parser
declaration/definition distinction.&nbsp; </b>In the 0.5.0 release, if
a function has a definition separate from its declaration, then there is
a function object created for each.&nbsp; This redundancy will be addressed.
<p><a NAME="Support hot code replace when debugging JDK 1.4 targets"></a><b>C/C++
Preprocessor upgrades.&nbsp; </b>The parser will be upgraded to provide
macro uses and conditional inclusion.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Debug</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Enable JSP debugging with JPDA"></a><b>Working directory
on run/debug launch.&nbsp; </b>Instead of starting a selected executable
from the project directory by default, the user now has the capability
to specify a different directory as the working directory.
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><a NAME="Add debugger support for step filtering"></a><b>Debugger detach.&nbsp;</b>
The user has the capability to start a debug session by attaching the session
to a running process.&nbsp; Upon termination of this debug session, the
debug engine will simply detach from the process.&nbsp; It will not terminate
the process.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Debugger Disassembly view.
</b>Disassembly
views are now generated dynamically as user steps into different sections
of the codes.&nbsp; The engine will automatically provide the user with
the disassembly view if a source file is not successfully located
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help Infrastructure</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Access help from parser
views.
</b>Access to Find Help from functions/classes objects.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Filtering preferences for help.
</b>Block
entries that match a regular expression pattern from being returned by
a search request.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Topic indexing for help. </b>Present
an appropriate description for each html result returned by a search.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Documentation</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Javadoc for extension
APIs.
</b>Provide javadoc comments and tags in public extension APIs for
DataStore tooling framework.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Tutorial - Autoconf. </b>A
walk through showing how to manage C/C++ projects from scratch. Also, another
walk through of importing an existing managed project and how to run it
using the autoconf features.
