Description:</STRONG> </P>
<P>The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a 
fully functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the 
Eclipse platform. </P>
<P>There are a number of groups contributing to the CDT; We strongly encourage 
interested parties to extend our work, thereby making the Eclipse CDT project a 
richer set of freely available resources. We are looking for contributions from 
the open source community in the areas of test, development, documentation, and 
general users who can help us ensure that the C/C++ tools work well on all the 
Eclipse platforms. </P>
<P>Our current release function includes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>C/C++ Editor (basic functionality, syntax highlighting, code completion 
  etc.) 
  <LI>C/C++ Debugger (APIs &amp; Default implementation, using GDB) 
  <LI>C/C++ Launcher (APIs &amp; Default implementation, launches and external 
  application) 
  <LI>Parser 
  <LI>Search Engine 
  <LI>Content Assist Provider 
  <LI>Makefile generator </LI></UL>

  <STRONG>Executive Summary:</STRONG> </P>
<p>Design for Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</p>
<ul>
  <li>The CDT project plans to better document and qualify their API in order 
    that other projects and ISVs have a well defined platform from which to integrate 
    and extend.</li>
</ul>
<p> Enterprise Ready </p>
<ul>
  <li>The CDT project recognizes the needs for a tools platform that can meet 
    the requirements and challenges of large projects on an Enterprise scale. 
    Future plans will take into account these needs.</li>
</ul>
<p> Performance and Scalability</p>
<ul>
  <li> The demands of development projects with extensive code basis requires 
    that the CDT project designs and develops a tools platform that can scale 
    from a single developer to large distributed development teams. Future enhancements 
    efforts will need to make this requirement a priority.<br>
