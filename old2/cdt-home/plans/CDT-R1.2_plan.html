<b>C/C++ Development Tools 1.2 Plan</b><b></b></h1>

</table><p>

This document lays out the plan for the next major release of the C/C++
Development Tools (CDT) Project, designated release 1.2. The two main goals
of the 1.2 release will be to round out the editing, searching and indexing
capabilities of the CDT, and to round out the CDT debugger.<br>
<b>Note: The CDT 1.2 release will only run on Eclipse R2.1.</b>
<p>This plan serves as an important input to the planning processes of
the various customers of the CDT Project. It tells them what to expect
(or what not to expect) in the next release so that they can plan their
projects accordingly.
<p>Plans are rarely completely unchanging over the life cycle of a release,
and this project is no exception. We will update this document as required
to reflect any changes to the plan. We reserve the right to add items to this
list. The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html" target="_top">developer
mailing list archives</a> contain further, in-depth information about how
a component is changing. Particular problem reports being worked on for
this release can be tracked through the Eclipse <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">bug
database</a>; the "Target Date" field reflects when a work item will
become available in the main development stream.</p>

<br>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Editing Capabilities</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Content/Code assist &amp; complete</li>

<ul>

Allows the user to search for different kinds of references to a specific
variable/function/object/method. Types of matches to look for could include
(Declarations, Implementers, References, All Occurrences, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<li>

given identifier (variables, functions, class names) when the mouse hovers
over it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
A wizard to automate the creating of a new class</li>
</ul>

<li>
Navigation Assistance</li>

<ul>
<li>
C/C++ Outline View</li>

<ul>
<li>
Filters to show/hide things like static members, non-public members, fields,
etc.</li>

<li>

<li>
Open header file referenced by a #include (may require build system support
to determine inclusion paths)</li>
</ul>

<li>

</ul>

<li>

</ul>

<li>

</ul>
<b></b>
<p><br><b>Build Capabilities</b>
<ul>
<li>
Continue progress on Managed Make Builder</li>

<ul>
<li>
Build a project using automatically generated makefile(s)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b></b>
<p><br><b>Debug Capabilities</b>
<ul>
<li>
Breakpoints</li>

<ul>
<li>
Defered Breakpoint(If the underlying debugger supports shared library loading
notification).</li>

<li>
Investigate action to set breakpoint for specific thread(if the underlying
debugger supports it) and session.</li>

<li>
Setting breakpoints on external sources with persistency on the project.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Presentation</li>

<ul>
<li>
Formating values (hex, octal, ...)</li>

<li>
Detail panel for Variable view.</li>

<li>
Casting variables to different types in the Variable view.</li>

<li>
Investigate a way to make static variables available even when not in the
context of the stackframe.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Debug protocol</li>

<ul>
<li>
Support for GDB/MI 2 (still support GDB/MI 1). This will allow using the
new MI2 features which will be found in gdb 6.0.</li>

<li>
Investigate variables book-keeping.&nbsp; The rationale; on some embedded
boards probing the variables at every step can be to intrusive and sometimes
destructive for example, accessing a volatile.</li>
</ul>

<li>
CDI</li>

<ul>
<li>
Documentation for the C/C++ Debug Interface(CDI)</li>

<li>
Commit the cdi-spy plugin as an example, the cdi-spy resembles jdt-spy,
it listens to all debug events(breakpoint, dll loading etc ..) and presents
the informaiton in a nice Treeview.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Documentation</b>
<ul>
<li>
Create a user's guide for the CDT as it stands today (release 1.1) and
begin documenting the capabilities being added in 1.2 as time permits. A preview 
of the Table of Contents for this user's guide can be found
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/cdt-home/plans/CDT-R1.2_online%20help%20TOC.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Update the user FAQs and HOWTOs on the web site.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Testing</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IBM/Rational team will
be dedicating some resources to test all of their contributions to version
1.2 of&nbsp; the CDT. In addition to that, we will continue broadening
of CDT testing to address areas that have not yet received any real test
coverage. Finally, an area of focus will also include CDT scalability with
large projects.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Work Items</b><b></b>
<p>Note that fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation, examples,
etc. are considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not
included in this plan unless they would also involve significant changes
to the plugin.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Timeframe</b>
<p>The timeframe for the CDT 1.2 release is mid-september. The feature
complete, freeze and GA target dates are
<br>as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Milestone 1 (M1) :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
August 15, 2003</li>

<li>
Freeze 1 (F1):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
September 5, 2003</li>

<li>
Release Candidate 1 (RC1):&nbsp;&nbsp; September 16, 2003</li>

<li>
General Availability (GA):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September
19, 2003</li>
</ul>
The CDT 2.0 release will be the next major release following the CDT 1.2
release. It is currently planned for the first quarter of 2004.
<br>Major features targetted for CDT 2.0 are outlined below.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Compatibility with Previous Release</b>
<p>API Contract Compatibility: The architecture for the CDT 1.2 is a little
different than the architecture of the previous releases. As a result,
there will be some
<br>API incompatibilitie with previous versions. As we work through integrations
with a wider variety of tools and round out the CDT functionality, these
APIs will freeze; this is one of the CDT 2.0 objectives.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>CDT 2.0 release</b><b></b>
<p>The CDT 2.0 release is planned for Q1/2004, and will focus on the following
areas:
<ul>
<li>
Refactoring - the ability to make system-wide code changes, optionally
previewing the changes that will result from the refactoring operation.</li>

<li>
Writable DOM - this will be required in order to support user-level capabilities
like refactoring.</li>

<li>
Managed Make System and build model - further work to firm up the build
model APIs, as well as complete the native CDT builder.</li>

<li>
Investigate and possibly develop a non-MI debugger back-end, for example
a native WIN32 debugger implementation.</li>

<li>
Investigate integration of the CDT and JDT debug capabilities, t provide
seamless debugging of mixed C/Java apps.</li>

<li>
Freeze the CDT integration APIs, ensuring compatibility between future
versions of CDT and other integrated tools.</li>
</ul>
