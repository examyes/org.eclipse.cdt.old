<h1>CDT Project<br>
  3.1 Plan</h1>
<p>Initial Document June 3, 2005<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:dev-cdt-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer mailing list.</i></p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release 
  of CDT after 3.0, designated release 3.1
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ProjectPlan">Project Plan - Themes &amp; Priorities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, we (the CDT Project) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
throughout the release cycle.

<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;

<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the CDT Project.
 Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
CDT. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.

<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to
several components; other may pervade the entire CDT Project. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in
no particular order.

<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. All interesting feature work is accounted for in
this plan.

<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that someone in 
    the CDT open source community has decided to address for the release (includes 
    development, testing, and documentation).</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed, deferred, or rejected.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but judged
    unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary
    of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating
    the discussion.</li>
  <li><b>No Commitment</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but no volunteers 
    have agreed to produce this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables: 
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for CDT Project, available as versions tagged 
      &quot;CDT_30&quot; 
    in the CDT Project <a href="http://dev.cdt.org/viewcvs/">CVS repository</a>.</li>
  <li> CDT Project (downloadable zips and update site) -- source + binary 
  distribution, used to develop on, or extend the CDT</li>
  <li>CDT runtime binary distribution (downloadable zips and update site) -- the 
  stuff needed to run CDT</li>
  <li>CDT Test Plugins (downloadable zips and update site) -- All the JUnit and 
  test infrastructure need to run the automated CDT tests</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestone occurring at regular intervals (~6 weeks) exist to facilitate 
  coarse-grained planning and staging. <br>
  <b>Synchronization Expectations</b><br>
  Once an Eclipse platform 3.1 milestone build is released, it will be vetted 
  for use by a subset of the CDT development team. Once approved as stable, all 
  CDT 3.0 development must move to that release of the Eclipse platform. Once 
  a CDT milestone build is complete, developers performing large scale CDT integration 
  will be expected to move forward to using that build for development. Every 
  effort will be made to ensure that the CDT milestone builds are stable platforms 
  for performing CDT integration, though perhaps not suitable for large scale 
  C/C++ development. 
<p>Note these dates are conditional on Eclipse 3.1 schedule<br>
<p> The milestones are: 
<ul>
  <p><i>Eclipse 3.1.x TBD </i></p>
  <p><strong>CDT 3.1 M1 - Date TBD</strong> - initial build</p>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 M2 - Date TBD</strong> - stable build reflecting progress, 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 M3 - Date TBD</strong> - stable build reflecting progress, 
    APIs are documented 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 M4 - Date TBD</strong> - stable build, feature complete. 
    This is considered RC0. Lock down and external testing begins with M4 and 
    progresses through a series of test-fix phases against candidate releases. 
    Focus on clearing bug backlog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Release candidate builds are planned as follows (M4 is RC0): 
<ul>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 RC1 </strong><strong>- Date TBD</strong> - Release Candidate</li>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 RC2 - Date TBD</strong> - Release Candidate </li>
  <li><strong>CDT 3.1 RC3 - Date TBD</strong>- Final Release Candidate</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; </p>


<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility of Release 3.1 with 3.0</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> </p>

<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> 
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> 
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> 
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the CDT API are inherently unsupportable and 
  receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier releases. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2><a name="ProjectPlan">CDT Project </a>Plan - Themes &amp; Priorities</h2>
<p> Plan items reflect new features of CDT, or areas where existing features will 
  be significantly reworked. Many of the changes under consideration for the next 
  release of the CDT address several of the Eclipse Themes; more detailed information 
  about the Eclipse themes can be found at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/councils/themes.html">this 
  location.</a> The themes covered by this release of CDT are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong> - Working with C/C++ source 
    offers a number of unique challenges. Work is underway to improve the scalability 
    of the underlying source code model to provide more rapid responses (for searching 
    and cross referencing) and more accurate results (for refactoring and outlining).</li>
  <li> Enterprise Ready </li>
  <li>Design Exstensibility: be a better platform.</li>
  <li><strong> Simple to Use: User Experience </strong>- A continued goal for 
    the CDT development team is enabling C/C++ developers to simply start developing 
    without requiring an enormous amount of set-up and configuration where avoidable. 
    There is much work in this area, specifically around the Managed Build System.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is broken down by the software modules that make up CDT; for more 
  information on these components see our project structure <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/developer/Project%20Structure.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">here</a>. 
  These modules are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Core">Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="#UI">UI</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Launch">Launch</a></li>
  <li><a href="#MakeBuilder">Standard Make Build</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ManagedBuild">Managed Build</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Debug">Debug</a></li>
  <li><a href="#refactoring">Refactor</a></li>
  <li>Doc</li>
</ul>
<p>For each software component in the plan we have identified the themes that 
  are being emphasized for this release. As well, the planned items for a given 
  component are characterized as either Committed, Proposed or Deferred. If you 
  are looking to contribute to the CDT project then deferred, proposed or 'no 
  commitment' items are good candidates to consider. If you would like to find 
  out more about how to get involved click <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/developer/Commitment.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Feature Description:</h3>
<h4>Format:</h4>
<p>Feature name: feature description, Bugzilla#, Priority(high, med, low), Status:(not 
  started, in progress, complete, hold), Target Milestone, Owner: name of committer</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>Resolver Model: The current file mappings/associations are standalone to CDT, 
  the resolver needs to propagate the information to the Eclipse platform. This 
  can now be done with the new ContentTypeManager and extension points in Eclipse-3.1 
  (PR 86645). Bugzilla entries: Priority:High, Status: in progress, Milestone: 
  M5 , Owner: QNX(AlainM)</p>
