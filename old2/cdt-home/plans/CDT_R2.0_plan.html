<p><i>Please send comments about this draft plan to
the </i><a href="mailto:eclipse-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer
mailing list.</i><br>
</p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature
release designated release 2.0.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Release_Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Release_Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Target_Operating_Environments">Target operating
environments</a></li>

  <li><a href="#Plan_Items">Plan Items</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely
static. To ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the
entire Eclipse community, we (the Eclipse PMC) post plans in an
embryonic form and revise them throughout the release cycle. </p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of
release deliverables, release milestones, target operating
environments,
and release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to
be clear for any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the various
Eclipse subprojects. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to
be added to Eclipse, or some aspect of Eclipse that is to be improved.
Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with
a title and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that
explains
the work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can
readily understand what the work item is without having to understand
the nitty-gritty detail. </p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be
quite large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that
is localized to a single Platform component; others may involve
coordinated changes to several components; other may pervade the entire
Platform. Although some plan items are for work that is more pressing
that others, the plan items appear in no particular order. </p>
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan
for how we will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test
coverage, documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are
considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not included
in this plan unless they would also involve a significant change to the
API or feature set, or involve a significant amount of work. All
interesting feature work is accounted for in this plan. </p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we
have decided to address for the release. </li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we
are considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to
say that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a
proposal will either be committed, deferred, or rejected.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not
make it in to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a
brief note as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface
as committed plan items at a later point, especially if someone
volunteers to carry out the item.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but
judged unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an
accompanying summary of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of
rejected items avoids repeating the discussion. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Release_Deliverables"></a>Release Deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables include the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for CDT available as versions tagged
"CDT_R2_0" in the Eclipse Tools <a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs">CVS
Repository</a></li>
  <li>Various CDT features released on the Eclipse Update Site as well
as distribution zips.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Release_Milestones"></a>Release Milestones</h2>
<p>Release milestones occuring at roughly 6 week intervals exist to
facilitate course-grained planning and staging.&nbsp; These milestones
are intended to line up with equivalent milestones in the <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html#Milestones">Eclipse
3.0 Project Plan</a>.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friday, November 21, 2003 - Milestone 1 (2.0 M1) - stable build
reflecting progress. Runs on Eclipse 3.0 M5.</li>
  <li>Friday, January 16, 2004 - Milestone 2 (2.0 M2) - stable build
reflecting progress. Runs on Eclipse 3.0 M6.</li>
  <li>Friday, February 27, 2004 - Milestone 3/Release Candidate 0 (2.0
RC0) - freeze date, only high priority defects allowed going forward.</li>
  <li>Friday, April 23, 2004 - General Availability (2.0 GA) - release
deliverables available for download (8 weeks after RC0)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Currently, the Eclipse 3.0 plan only sets out M6. This plan
assumes the next milestone will be RC0. If this is not the case, the
CDT
plan will be changed to line up with the Eclipse 3.0 plan.</b></i><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Target_Operating_Environments"></a>Target Operating
Environments</h2>
<p>The objective is to support the CDT on all target operating
environments listed in the <a

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The CDT is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The
user interface elements provided by the CDT, including dialogs and
error
messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as the
default resource bundles.<br>
</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the CDT on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK
on
the Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported
by the Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Specific notes on different
languages? Details on BIDI support</span><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Compatibility_with_Previous_Releases"></a>Compatibility
with Previous Releases</h2>
<p>One of the main themes for this release of the CDT will be
solidifying and documenting the APIs to various functions in the CDT.
As
such, no committment is made to maintain compatibility with previous
releases. Every effort will be made to maximize compatibility, and area
that do require change will be documented and communicated to the
community.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Plan_Items"></a>Plan Items</h2>
<p>The plan items listed in this section reflect new features of the
CDT, or areas where existing features will be significantly reworked.
Numbers in parentheses link to bugzilla problem reports for that plan
item (<a
 href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=CDT&amp;keywords=plan&amp;target_milestone=2.0">query
bugzilla for all CDT 2.0 plan items</a>). </p>
<p><i>**Note: The eclipse project follows the convention of creating a
bugzilla entry (</i><a
 href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=JDT&amp;product=PDE&amp;product=Platform&amp;keywords=plan&amp;target_milestone=3.0&amp;target_milestone=3.0+M1&amp;target_milestone=3.0+M2&amp;target_milestone=3.0+M3&amp;target_milestone=3.0+M4&amp;target_milestone=3.0+M5">query
bugzilla for all Eclipse 3.0 plan items</a>)<i> for all planning items,
which is essentially a defect report with the following characteristics:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; severity =
enhancement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; keyword = plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; summary begins with
"[plan item]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; target = Release in
which the plan item will be delivered</i></p>
<p>The items are grouped by theme to reflect the two key customers of
the CDT - end users and ISVs wishing to integrate their tools with the
CDT. The themes are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#CDT%20Platform%20Theme%20-%20User%20Experience">User
Experience Theme</a> - improve the experience of the user writing C/C++
code.</li>
  <li><a href="#CDT%20Platform%20Theme%20-%20ISV%20Enablement">ISV
Enablement Theme</a> - improve the ability for ISVs and other
developers
to create tools that interact with the CDT and each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="CDT Platform Theme - User Experience"></a>Theme: User
Experience</h3>
<h4>Committed Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse
3.0 support.</span> Aligning with Eclipse 3.0 is the main task for this
release. This means more than just getting the CDT to compile and run
on
Eclipse 3.0. It also means ensuring the CDT provides the same look at
feel and supports a number of the new features that are being provided
by the Eclipse Platform.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rename
refactoring.</span> This feature represents our first foray into the
world of refactoring. This includes bringing in a refactoring framework
that is very similar to the JDT's refactoring framework. The focus is
then on rename refactoring which will leverage off and make
improvements to the C/C++ Search
feature to correctly refactor the references.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content
assist enhancements.</span>
The
code completion part of the contents assist feature will be enhanced
for
performance, handling of C visibility rules, and for the handling of
C++ code completion on members.
&nbsp;The majority of this work will be to make more use of the parser
to provide accurate and speedy competion proposals.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Managed
Build enhancements.</span> The managed build feature will be enhanced
for usability and for flexibility to support a large variety of build
target environments as well as to better support multiple
configurations of tool and tool settings. Support will also be added
for handling different variety of underlying tools including different
make utilities, as well as support for different file types (like
lex/yacc).<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">User
Documentation enhancements.</span> The user documentation will be
expanded on to ensure the success of new and experienced users of the
CDT.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internationalization
and Accessibility. </span>Normally, these capabilities should be
designed into features as they have been developed. Areas where this
hasn't be done will be addressed in this release.<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C/C++
Search enhancements.</span>
This feature will be enhanced to add the capability of selecting a name
in the editor and searching for declarations, definitions, and
references to that name. The parser will be used to determine
accurately the appropriate C/C++ definition of the name to be used in
the search.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C++
Class Browser/C++ Hierarchy View.</span>&nbsp;
A view dedicated to the navigation of C++ class hierarchies associated
with objects or classes defined in a project. This include the ability
to see class members, their specifications (public, private, protected,
virtual, etc), their overrides, and the inheritance structure (both
inherited from and inherited by).<br>
</p>
<h4>Deferred Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick
Fix.</span>&nbsp; Do something like the Quick Fix feature in Java.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixed
Java/C/C++ Development.</span>&nbsp; Support the writing, building, and
debugging of native methods in a mixed Java/C/C++ environment. If we
want to get real good, support the debugging of an embedded JVM in a
C/C++ application. Java calling C, C calling Java...<br>
</p>
<h4>Rejected Items<br>
</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">None at this time.</p>
<h3><a name="CDT Platform Theme - ISV Enablement"></a>Theme: ISV
Enablement</h3>
<h4>Committed Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ISV
documentation.</span> A new help plugin will be created that will
provide documentation that will help ISVs who wish to integrate with
different aspects of the CDT. This document will provide a reference
section<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parser
extensibility.</span> To
support
different language variants as supported by different compilers, a
mechanism needs to be in place to change the parser to adapt to those
variants. This will ensure accurate results for Search, Content Assist,
and other features that rely on the parser.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Documentation
extensibility.</span> To
support providing the user documentation during content assist and text
hover, an extensibility mechanism will need to be put in place to
support different documentation content providers.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools
integration extensibility. </span>To support integration with
different tools for different tasks, a model describing these tools
(sometimes called a Target model) is required. This model would provide
such information as command name and available options. It would also
provide information for specific parts of the CDT such as providing a
mechanism to provide default symbols and inclusion paths for a compiler.<br>
</p>
<h4>Deferred Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">None at this time.</p>
<h4>Rejected Items</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">None at this time.<br>
