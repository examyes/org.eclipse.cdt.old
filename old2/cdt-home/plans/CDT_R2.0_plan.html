<h1>Eclipse CDT<br>
DRAFT 2.0 Plan</h1>
<p>Last revised Monday, September 29, 2003<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the
</i><a href="mailto:eclipse-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a> <i>developer
mailing list.</i><br>
</p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature
release of the CDT after 1.2, designated release 2.0.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Release_Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Release_Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Target_Operating_Environments">Target operating
environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility_with_Previous_Releases">Compatibility
with previous releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Component_Plans">Component plans</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely
static. To ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the
entire Eclipse community, we (the Eclipse PMC) post plans in an
embryonic form and revise them throughout the release cycle. </p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of
release deliverables, release milestones, target operating
environments, and release-to-release compatibility. These are all
things that need to be clear for any release, even if no features were
to change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the various
Eclipse subprojects. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to
be added to Eclipse, or some aspect of Eclipse that is to be improved.
Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with
a title and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that
explains the work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone
can readily understand what the work item is without having to
understand the nitty-gritty detail. </p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be
quite large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that
is localized to a single Platform component; others may involve
coordinated changes to several components; other may pervade the entire
Platform. Although some plan items are for work that is more pressing
that others, the plan items appear in no particular order. </p>
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan
for how we will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test
coverage, documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are
considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not included
in this plan unless they would also involve a significant change to the
API or feature set, or involve a significant amount of work. All
interesting feature work is accounted for in this plan. </p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we
have decided to address for the release. </li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we
are considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to
say that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a
proposal will either be committed, deferred, or rejected. </li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not
make it in to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a
brief note as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface
as committed plan items at a later point. </li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but
judged unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an
accompanying summary of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of
rejected items avoids repeating the discussion. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Release_Deliverables"></a>Release Deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables include the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for CDT available as versions tagged
"CDT_R2_0" in the Eclipse Tools <a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs">CVS Repository</a></li>
  <li>Various CDT features released on the Eclipse Update Site as well
as distribution zips.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Release_Milestones"></a>Release Milestones</h2>
<p>Release milestones occuring at roughly 6 week intervals exist to
facilitate course-grained planning and staging.&nbsp; These milestones
are intended to line up with equivalent milestones in the <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html#Milestones">Eclipse
3.0 Project Plan</a>.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friday, November 21, 2003 - Milestone 1 (2.0 M1) - stable build
reflecting progress. Runs on Eclipse 3.0 M5.</li>
  <li>Friday, January 16, 2004 - Milestone 2 (2.0 M2) - stable build
reflecting progress. Runs on Eclipse 3.0 M6.</li>
  <li>Friday, February 27, 2004 - Milestone 3/Release Candidate 0 (2.0
RC0) - freeze date, only high priority defects allowed going forward.</li>
  <li>Friday, April 23, 2004 - General Availability (2.0 GA) - release
deliverables available for download (8 weeks after RC0)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Currently, the Eclipse 3.0 plan only sets out M6. This plan assumes
the next milestone will be RC0. If this is not the case, the CDT plan
will be changed to line up with the Eclipse 3.0 plan.</b></i><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Target_Operating_Environments"></a>Target Operating
Environments</h2>
<p>The objective is to support the CDT on all target operating
environments listed in the <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Eclipse
3.0 Project Plan</a>. This list is as follows:<br>

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The CDT is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The
user interface elements provided by the CDT, including dialogs and
error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as
the default resource bundles.<br>
</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the CDT on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK
on the Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are
supported by the Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Specific notes on different
languages? Details on BIDI support</span><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Compatibility_with_Previous_Releases"></a>Compatibility
with Previous Releases</h2>
<p>One of the main themes for this release of the CDT will be
solidifying and documenting the APIs to various functions in the CDT.
As such, no committment is made to maintain compatibility with previous
releases. Every effort will be made to maximize compatibility, and area
that do require change will be documented and communicated to the
community.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Component_Plans"></a>Component Plans</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this plan, the CDT is considered to consist of 4
components:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#CDTPlatform">CDT Platform component</a></li>
  <li>CDT Debug component</li>
  <li>CDT Standard Make component</li>
  <li>CDT Managed Make component<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For each component, the items listed reflect new features of the
CDT, or areas where existing features will be significantly reworked.
Numbers in parentheses link to bugzilla problem reports for that plan
item (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=CDT&keywords=plan&target_milestone=2.0">query
bugzilla for all CDT 2.0 plan items</a>).
</p>
<p><i>**Note: The eclipse project follows the convention of creating a bugzilla 
entry (</i><a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=JDT&product=PDE&product=Platform&keywords=plan&target_milestone=3.0&target_milestone=3.0+M1&target_milestone=3.0+M2&target_milestone=3.0+M3&target_milestone=3.0+M4&target_milestone=3.0+M5">query
bugzilla for all Eclipse 3.0 plan items</a>)<i> for all planning items, which is 
essentially a defect report with the following characteristics:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; severity = enhancement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; keyword = plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; summary begins with &quot;[plan 
item]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; target = Release in which the 
plan item will be delivered</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="CDTPlatform"></a>CDT Platform component</h3>
<p>The CDT Platform provides the foundation for tooling used for C/C++
development. Included in the platform are things like the C/C++ editor,
resource management for C/C++ projects, fundamental build pieces shared
by builders, the C/C++ search engine, the C/C++ parser used by the
editor (outline view), the search engine, and others.<br>
</p>
<p>The following work items reflect new features of the CDT platform component, or areas where
existing features will be significantly reworked. The kinds of changes
under consideration for the next release of the CDT platform address two general
themes. The committed, proposed, and deferred plan items are grouped in
sections by theme:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#CDT Platform Theme - User Experience">User Experience Theme</a> - improve the experience of the user writing
C/C++ code.</li>
  <li><a href="#CDT Platform Theme - ISV Enablement">ISV Enablement Theme</a> - improve the ability for ISVs and other
developers to create tools that interact with the CDT and each other.</li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="CDT Platform Theme - User Experience"></a>Theme: User Experience</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="CDT Platform Theme - ISV Enablement"></a>Theme: ISV Enablement</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
