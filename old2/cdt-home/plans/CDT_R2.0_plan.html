<h1>
C/C++ Development Tools - CDT Project<br>
R2.0 Plan</h1>
Last revised February 27, 2002
<br>First edition January 23, 2002<br>
This document lays out the plan for the next major release of the C/C++
Development Tools (CDT) Project, designated release 2.0. The main emphasis
of the 2.0 release will be to enable CDT to run on Eclipse R2.0. <b>Note
that the CDT 2.0 release will only run on Eclipse R2.0 or later.</b>
<p>This plan serves as an important input to the planning processes of
the various customers of the CDT Project. It tells them what to expect
(or what not to expect) in the next release so that they can plan their
projects accordingly.
<p>Plans are rarely completely unchanging over the life cycle of a release,
and this project is no exception. We will update this document as required
to reflect any changes the plan. We reserve the right to add items to this
list. The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html" target="_top">developer
mailing list archives</a> contain further, in-depth information about how
a component is changing. Particular problem reports being worked on for
this release can be tracked through the Eclipse <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">bug
database</a>; the "Target Milestone" field reflects when a work item will
become available in the main development stream.
<h2>

<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Compatibility with Previous Release</h2>

<p><br><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> CDT 2.0 will be upwards contract
compatible with CDT 1.0 unless noted. This means that programs in full
compliance with contracts specified in the CDT 1.0 APIs will automatically
be in full compliance with the CDT 2.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with the CDT 2.0
APIs would ensure compliance with the CDT 1.0 APIs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Work Items</h2>
Note that fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation, examples,
etc. are considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not
included in this plan unless they would also involve significant changes
to the plugin.
<p>The following committed items reflect new features of CDT, or areas
where existing features will be significantly reworked.
<blockquote><a NAME="Reduce memory footprint for Java builder"></a><b>Eclipse
2.0 compliance.&nbsp; </b>Any rework to get CDT to run on Eclipse 2.0.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>EPDC 308.&nbsp; </b>The base
debugger infrastructure shipped with Eclipse has been upgraded.&nbsp; CDT
needs to synchronize with this.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Debugger detach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Eclipse 2.0 provides an additional button on the toolbar:&nbsp; "Disconnect".&nbsp;
In order to support it/take advantage of it, there is need to change the
current behavior of the "Terminate" button - which is to detach in case
the program was attached originally.&nbsp; So the new behavior will be
to Terminate if the "Terminate" button was pushed, and to detach if the
"Disconnect" button was pushed.
<br>&nbsp;

<h4>
Uncommitted Items</h4>
<i>N.B. The following is the list of important CDT subproject work items
which we are presently unable to commit to for the 2.0 release. Wherever
possible, we will try to complete these items. Depending on how things
work out, we should be able complete some of them. However, we cannot promise
that we will complete any of them, and it would be unwise to gamble otherwise.
Items not completed for 2.0 will carry over to the planning of the next
release. We will revise this 2.0 plan as soon as we can definitively commit
to any of them.</i>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><b>General</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Multiple environment
support, inheritance.&nbsp; </b>There is a need to be able to discretely
apply a set of environment variables to a Project, Command, or Debug Session.&nbsp;
This method should be uniform across the CDT (and perhaps Eclipse at some
point).&nbsp; One way is to create a type of object that is essentially
a named environment.&nbsp; A Named Environment could then contain other
Named Environments as well as Environment Variables.&nbsp; In various places
in the UI would allow a user to chose which Named Environment should be
used for their command, debug session or project.&nbsp; This will require
a thorough design discussion.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>In-table creation of command
specification.&nbsp; </b>Creating new command specs by directly editing
the cells from the table tree view instead of using the wizard dialog.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Breakpoint from browse views
(statement, function, class).&nbsp; </b>Add the ability to set breakpoint(s)
on C/C++ objects in a view by selecting "Set Breakpoint" in a context sensitive
menu.&nbsp; If the selected object is a statement, then a breakpoint is
set on the line, in the file of the statement.&nbsp; If the selected object
is a function, then a breakpoint is set on the first statement of the function.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the selected object is a class, then the first statement of every member
function for the class gets a breakpoint.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Distinguish executable/non-exec
files.&nbsp; </b>In the Filesystem Miner, add the ability to distinguish
between executable and non executable files.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a directory
is queried, this distinction should be made and the type of all executable
files should be "executable file" instead of "file", which is more general.&nbsp;
This will allow the contribution of actions specifically for executable
files that surface themselves in the UI (ie. debug, run, etc).
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Internationalization enablement.&nbsp;
</b>Need to go through the remaining hardcoded strings, move them to .properties
files and then use getLocalizedString() calls instead of the hardcoded
strings in the code.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Data miner dependency mechanism.&nbsp;
</b>Right now miners are loaded in the order in which they appear in the
minerFile.dat file.&nbsp; The schemas of miners are also loaded in this
order.&nbsp; The problem with this is it requires miner schema dependencies
to also follow this order.&nbsp; It is better for the miners to indicate
their dependencies independently of the order they appear in minerFile.dat
so that the framework can know to load the schemas of the miners in the
correct order.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Network re-connect. </b>Add
the ability for the client and server DataStores to preserve their data
and re-connect after a short period of network downtime.&nbsp; When the
client detects network failure, it should wait a predetermined amount of
time before attempting to re-connect to the server.&nbsp; After a certain
number of failures, the client should give up and gracefully clean up it's
meta-information.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the server detects network failure,
it should wait a predetermined amount of time for any re-connect attempts
before shutting down.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Right mouse button (RMB) run/debug.&nbsp;
</b>Once we are able to distinguish between exe and non-exe files, we should
add exe-specific actions to the views.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Add/remove C++ nature.&nbsp;
</b>We can already add C/C++ natures to a non-C/C++ project, thus making
it a C/C++ project.&nbsp; We should also be able to reverse this operation.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Password encrypt and preserve.&nbsp;
</b>Currently a user needs to specify his/her user ID and password whenever
he/she connects to a remote machine through the DataStore framework regardless
of whether the same connection was made earlier in a session.&nbsp;&nbsp;
By using encryption it should be safe to preserve the password, which will
allow a user to connect without having to specify his/her password repeatedly.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Unification of Path (source,
lib, include) for debug, autoconf, parse.&nbsp; </b>Currently we have the
notion of a parse include path along with a UI piece for defining the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The notion of a set of paths is useful in other areas too - ie. debug,
autoconf.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parser makes use of this path to find external
includes, but I could also use a external "source" path to parse external
source files.&nbsp; For debug, our source locator can make use of this
path to find external source and included files.&nbsp;&nbsp; For autoconf,
the include path and the lib path can be used when generating makefiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The benefit of unifying the path, is that it's conceptually easier for
a user and it reduces redundancies.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Command execution unifier.&nbsp;
</b>Some users have indicated that there are a multiplicity of methods
to launch commands.&nbsp; Some thought towards unification may ease usability.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autoconf</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Makefile.am view (build
target, change target type, etc.).&nbsp; </b>A view of the Makefile.am,
which will facilitate the building /modification of Makefile.am files.
In addition, there will be a number of actions that can be invoked on the
Makefile.am targets from the view. These action includes: build, rename,
add, copy and delete to name a few
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Custom actions for makefile.am
(set CFLAGS, rename targets, build targets).&nbsp; </b>Providing custom
action that enable the user to manage what does in the Makefile.am. As
an example: setting the CFLAGS variable
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Smart update for .am variables.&nbsp;
</b>Enabling the system to provide full automatic update for the configuration
files used by automake and autoconf by handling the updates needed for
all of the Makefile.am variables.<b></b>
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Create templates for KDE/Gnome
projects.&nbsp; </b>Providing support and to facilitate the use of automake
and autoconf to manage KDE and Gnome projects.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C/C++ Parser</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>C++ name scoping.&nbsp;
</b>The parser needs to be able properly handle out-of-block definitions
of things such as member functions.&nbsp; The idea is that the member function
objects should appear in the class they belong to, not in the scope where
their code exists.&nbsp; The important part is that most users will want
to get to both the definition and declaration of the function, so what
is the best way to support this with one function object?
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Pragma directives. </b>Investigation
needs to be done to determine if any compiler pragmas should be supported
by the parser.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>GCC language extensions.&nbsp;
</b>The gcc compiler supports many non-ANSI "extensions".&nbsp; Work needs
to be done to determine how many of these extensions the parser could (or
should) support.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Breakpoints - watchpoints.&nbsp;
</b>Add implementation to support Gdb's watchpoints.&nbsp; A watchpoint
is a special breakpoint that stops the program when the value of an expression
changes.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Variable types.&nbsp; </b>Enable
the capability to show variable types for the monitors in Variables View
and Monitors View.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Variable representation change.&nbsp;
</b>Allow users to display variable monitors in different representations.&nbsp;
Some of the supported representations include hex, integer, floating point,
character, etc.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Update locals instead of add/remove.&nbsp;
</b>Add implementation to book-keep local variables.&nbsp; Book-keeping
local variables will improve performance as it eliminates excessive processing
from UI and reduces the amount of communication between Debug UI and GdbPicl.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Allow running and stepping
in Disassembly and Mixed view.&nbsp; </b>Add implementation to allow stepping
and running by the assembler instructions from disassembly view and mixed
view.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Mixed view.&nbsp; </b>Mixed
view is a special view that intermixes a file's source code with its respective
assembler instructions.&nbsp; Each executable line in a source file is
followed by its own set of assembler instructions.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Breakpoints - function, address,
conditional.&nbsp; </b>Add support for function breakpoint and address
breakpoint.&nbsp; Also add implementations to allow users to specify conditions
for breakpoints.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Tracepoints.&nbsp; </b>In some
applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the program's
execution as the program's correctness depends on its real-time behavior.&nbsp;
Tracepoints are provided by Gdb to examine the program without interrupting
the program's execution. For each tracepoint, the user can specify, in
advance, some arbitrary set of data to collect as the program hits the
tracepoints.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Storage representation change.&nbsp;
</b>For storage view, only one type of storage representation is currently
supported.&nbsp; Need to add implementations in GdbPicl to support other
storage monitor representations.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Break on C++ throw/catch.&nbsp;
</b>GdbPicl needs implementations to stop the program at any C++ exception
thrown by the application.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Stdin/stdout/stderr for run/debug.&nbsp;
</b>Standard input, output and error are used by GdbPicl to communicate
with Gdb.&nbsp; As a result, program's output and error messages are not
displayed in any console views.&nbsp; Users also have no means of interacting
with the debugged program directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; GdbPicl needs implementations
to properly filter out program's output for display and to allow users
to interact with the program.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Update only open debug views.&nbsp;
</b>GdbPicl is required to keep track of a lot of program's state information
during a debug session.&nbsp; Some of this information requested by the
UI is not needed as the views for displaying this information may not be
active or opened.&nbsp; UI should better keep track of the views and only
request the minimum amount of info from the engine.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Update after GDB console commands.&nbsp;
</b>GDB Console is provided for users to interact with Gdb directly.&nbsp;
However, the UI is not currently updated properly after commands are issued
in GDB Console.&nbsp; GdbPicl needs to re-query the program's status and
update UI accordingly after commands are issued in GDB Console.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Single socket UI daemon.&nbsp;
</b>This is a request from the Debugger UI to switch GdbPicl to use the
new single socket UI daemon.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Exception rerun.&nbsp; </b>Allow
user to reset and rerun an exception when an exception is raised.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Exception filtering.&nbsp;
</b>GdbPicl stops the program whenever an exception is thrown.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Exception filtering allows users to choose from a list of supported exceptions
and the program will only be stopped at those selected exceptions.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Process view and actions.&nbsp;
</b>Provide a view that displays a list of running processes from the system.&nbsp;
This is especially useful when a user needs to attach a running process
to a debug session.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Load Breakpoint.&nbsp; </b>This
type of breakpoint stops when a specified shared library, dll or object
is loaded.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Module view.&nbsp; </b>This
view displays all the modules (shared library, DLL or executable) that
the program is dependent on.&nbsp; For each module, the view also shows
a list of files and functions belonging to the module.&nbsp; Due to performance
issues, this view is currently disabled.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Pointer dereference.&nbsp;
</b>Add action "dereference" in "Monitors" and "Variables" view for pointer
monitors.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help Infrastructure</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Control of Gnome Help
Browser.&nbsp; </b>The Search Docs view currently launches a new instance
of the gnome-help-browser for every search result selected. Need to control
the browser so that one instance is reused.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Help using remote information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Currently, the access to help information is meant for local projects only.
Need to provide access to documentation that resides on a remote machine.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutorial</b>
<blockquote><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Writing tools using
parse database.&nbsp; </b>The results of a parse action are stored in the
datastore.&nbsp; The user has access to this wealth of information.&nbsp;
This tutorial will explain the necessary steps required to access this
information.<b></b>
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Tutorial - Miner writer. </b>Explain
the steps of writing a miner and interfacing the extension APIs by writing
a sample miner.
<p><a NAME="Improve data inspectors"></a><b>Tutorial - Datastore plugin
writer.&nbsp; </b>Explain the steps to interface the client DataStore APIs
by writing a sample Eclipse plugin to make use of a sample miner.
