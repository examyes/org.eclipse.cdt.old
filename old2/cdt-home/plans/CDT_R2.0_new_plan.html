<h1>
C/C++ Development Tools - CDT Project<br>
R2.0 Updated Plan</h1>
<p>First edition July 10, 2002<p>
<p>Second edition July 25, 2002<p>
This document lays out the plan for the next major release of the C/C++
Development Tools (CDT) Project, designated release 2.0. The two main goals
of the 2.0 release will be to enable CDT to run on Eclipse R2.0, and to define 
and implement a fully extensible framework.  <b>Note
that the CDT 2.0 release will only run on Eclipse R2.0 or later.</b>
<p>This plan serves as an important input to the planning processes of
the various customers of the CDT Project. It tells them what to expect
(or what not to expect) in the next release so that they can plan their
projects accordingly.
<p>Plans are rarely completely unchanging over the life cycle of a release,
and this project is no exception. We will update this document as required
to reflect any changes to the plan. We reserve the right to add items to this
list. The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html" target="_top">developer
mailing list archives</a> contain further, in-depth information about how
a component is changing. Particular problem reports being worked on for
this release can be tracked through the Eclipse <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">bug
database</a>; the "Target Milestone" field reflects when a work item will
become available in the main development stream.

<h2>Release deliverables</h2>
The release deliverables are:
<ul>
  <li> Source Code for framework</li>
  <li> Source Code for default implementation of all functionality (more detail to be added) </li>
</ul>

<h2>
Compatibility with Previous Release</h2>

<p><br><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> The architecture for the CDT 2.0 is completely different than
the architecture of the CDT 1.0 release. As a result, there will be no compatibility supported, between version 1.0 and 2.0.
</p>
<p>
Future releases will strive to be contract compatibile built upon the 2.0 contracts.
This means that programs in full compliance with contracts specified in the CDT 2.0 APIs will automatically
be in full compliance with the CDT 3.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with the CDT 3.0
APIs would ensure compliance with the CDT 2.0 APIs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Work Items</h2>
Note that fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation, examples,
etc. are considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not
included in this plan unless they would also involve significant changes
to the plugin.
<p>The following committed items reflect new features of CDT, or areas
where existing features will be significantly reworked.</p>

TBD
