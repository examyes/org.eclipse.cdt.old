  <li><b><a name="general_10">What is the CDT?</a></b>
    <p>
     The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a fully functional C and C++ Integrated 
     Development Environment (IDE). Our focus is development on Linux for deployment on Linux, 
     but we are interested in participation from others who would like to extend our work in other directions.  The 
     CDT is fully open-source and implemented purely in java as a set of plugins to the 
     <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> platform.  To learn more visit the 
     <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt">CDT Home Page</a>.
    </p>

  <li><b><a name="general_20">How is the CDT licensed?</a></b>
   <p>The CDT consists of software produced by the CDT team combined with third party software developed from other
      Open Source Projects.  The software produced by the CDT team is licensed under the 
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v05.html">Common Public License</a>.  The software designed by

    CDT related questions that are not answered in this FAQ or the documentation should be posted to the

    You will need a <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/newsManager/newsRequestForm.html">password</a>.  You can

    Keep in mind that these newsgroups are public, so do not include any confidental information in your questions.

    NOTE: Please submit bugs to <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs">bugzilla</a>, not to the newsgroups.

  </li>
  
  <li><b><a name="general_60">How do I report a bug or request a feature?</a></b> 
   <p>
    The CDT Project (like the Eclipse Project) uses 
    <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a> as its bug and feature tracking system. Entering a 
    bug\feature report is as simple as filling in a web form on the 
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">eclipse bugzilla page</a>. The first time you enter a bug you 
    will need to <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/createaccount.cgi">create
    a new bugzilla account</a> for yourself by providing an email address and
    choosing a password.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before enterring a bug report, you should 
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi">search bugzilla</a> to see if someone else has already 
    entered a bug report similar to yours. If you find a bug report that outlines the problem you are seeing,
    you can simply annotate it with your comments to let the developers know that you have also hit the bug.
    Also you can add yourself to the CC list of the bug so that you will notified when the status of the bug 
    changes or someone adds comments.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once you have searched bugzilla and not found anything, you can go ahead
    and enter a new bug report. Please read the bug writing guidelines located
    on the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugzilla.html">eclipse bug reporting page</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    To make your bug report more helpful include the following in your bug reports:
    <ol>
      <li>The build level of both the CDT and Eclipse that you are using.  
       For example, "cdt 20020508 with Eclipse M5 Stable Build"</li>
      <li>Your computer's specifications (OS + level, memory, other pertinent info)</li>
      <li>The contents of your .log file (or lack thereof).  This is especially
      important if you get a dialog that reports an internal error.  See
      <a href="#general_70">What is this .log file I hear so much about?</a> for information on 
      on finding your .log file.</li>
      <li>The Java runtime or development kit you are using to run eclipse (use
        java -version or java -fullversion)</li>
      <li>A description of what you were doing when you encountered the bug</li>
      <li>An explanation of how the observed behavior differs from the expected
        behavior</li>
     </ol>
    </p>
   <hr size="1">
  </li>

  <li><b><a name="general_70">What is this .log file I hear so much about?</a></b>
  <p>
   The .log file is used by the Eclipse Platform to log runtime errors.  It is invaluable when debugging both 
   problems with plugins not starting, as well as any exceptions they may throw once loaded.  A .log file 
   should always be included when opening a bug against the CDT or Eclipse (or if there is no .log file, that
   fact should be mentioned in the bug).
  </p>
  <p>
   The .log file is located in the workspace/.metadata directory (or sometimes just in the .metadata directory).

 <li><b><a name="install_10">Which CDT build should I download?</a></b>
  <p>
   There are currently 2 versions of the CDT:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>R1</b> - for use with the Eclipse Release <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_top">R1.0</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>R2</b> - for which we provide periodic builds that are for use with specific Eclipse <b>Stable</b> R2.0 Builds.
  </p>
  So,<br>
  <ul>
   <li>If you are using Eclipse Release R1.0, the you should download CDT R1.</li>
   <li>If you are using a <b>Stable</b> R2 Eclipse Build, then check the 
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/downloads/main.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project#">
    CDT Download Page</a> for information on which CDT Build to use.</li>
   <li>If you are using an <b>Integration</b> or <b>Nightly</b> Eclipse Build, then you can download the closest CDT 
    R2 match, but you do so at your own risk since it is possible that Eclipse has changed enough since the last 
    <b>Stable</b> build to break the CDT.</li>  
  </ul><br>
   <hr size="1">
 </li>
 
 <li><b><a name="install_20">Which operating systems does the CDT support?</a></b>
  <p>
   Since the CDT can be used to remotely develop C/C++ applications, this question can be interpreted in 2 ways:<br>
   1) What operating systems does the CDT run on?<br>
   2) What operating systems does the CDT support C/C++ Development On.
  </p>
  ?
   <hr size="1">
  </li>
 
  <li><b><a name="install_25">Why isn't the XXX operating system supported by CDT? (XXX usually == Windows, but may take on other values)</a></b>
  <p>
   "Supported" has a particular meaning to us.   It means that on that platform we have a good level of 
   confidence that CDT works correctly and that its function is appropriate and complete.   That means
   <ul>
    <li>someone has ensured that the function addesses the important use cases</li>
    <li>the function is exercised by regular execution of a test plan</li>
    <li>identified problems are tracked to resolution</li>
    <li>there is a recipient for user feedback</li>
    <li>code patches are developed as necessary to correct or extend CDT on that platform </li>
   </ul>
   To make this all happen a platform has an Owner - someone who accepts the responsibility to make sure 
   those things all happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IBM CDT team owns Linux support but doesn't have the capacity to own other platforms.
    That doesn't mean we don't care about them.  It certainly doesn't mean we won't accept
    code changes for them - it is already the case that much of CDT will work outside of Linux
    and there is non-Linux code in CDT to accomplish that.<br>
    It does mean that we can't "own" those platforms, and without an owner we don't have the necessary 
    confidence to claim support.
  </p>
  <p>
   If this answer makes you want to volunteer to own a platform, that is the reaction we were 
   hoping for!
  </p>  
  <hr size="1">
  </li>  

 <li><b><a name="install_30">I can't find the CDT download for Windows, isn't there one?</a></b>
  <p>
   There is no special download for Windows.  Much of the CDT function will work on Windows, but in some cases
   we are leveraging Linux system tools for things like debugging (gdb), autoconf support, and profiling (gprof).  
   So this function will not work "out of the box" on Windows. 
  </p>
  <p>
   However, installing the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/download/cygwin.html">Cygwin toolkit</a>, which is a Unix
   environment for Windows, gets you most of this function.

  <li><b><a name="install_60">How do I uninstall CDT?</a></b>
  <p>
   We do not currently ship an uninstaller.  Once we have moved up to the latest "Update" support in Eclipse this 
   should be taken care of.  In the meantime you can uninstall the CDT in 2 manual steps: 
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Remove the CDT plugins
    <ul>
     <li>Navigate to the directory where the CDT plugins are installed (typically eclipse/plugins)</li>
     <li>Remove the following plugins:

       <li>org.eclipse.cdt.*</li>
       <li>com.ibm.debug*</li>
       <li>com.ibm.lpex*</li>
