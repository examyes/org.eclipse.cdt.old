<h1>CDT Content Assist Feature Spec<br>
<small>For CDT Release 2.0</small></h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This feature is often also called
code assist. However, the concept originates in the Eclipse Platform
with the JFace text editor. As such, this feature applies to more then
just code. Besides, the interface is called IContentAssistant.</span><br>
</p>
<p>Content assist is a feature that is heavy used in many development
environments and developers soon rely on since it is such a great
productivity enhancer. This feature is seen as critical to the
acceptance of the CDT by the mass C/C++ development community.<br>
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Essentially, when invoked, content assist will present a scrollable
list of potential code fragments that can be inserted at the current
cursor location. The following content can be inserted:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>[P1] Code completion - determines the best code that can be
inserted at the current location. The completions must take into
account scoping rules for the current language variant (e.g. link scope
for C). The types of completions include:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>[P1] calls to global functions or use of global variables <br>
    </li>
    <li>[P1] use of local variables</li>
    <li>[P1] use of types</li>
    <li>[P1] calls to member functions and use of member variables</li>
    <li>[P2] keywords</li>
  </ul>
  <li>[P2] Code templates - presents a list of code templates that can
be applied in the current cursor position. Example templates can
include C code structures such as 'for' statements, or larger templates
like classes or member functions. The list of templates must be
extendible to allow plugins to provide additional templates.</li>
  <li>[P3] Virtual member function override - when the cursor is an
appropriate place in a class, the list of potential virtual method
overrides would be supplied in the completion list.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the mouse hovers over one of the list items, and
additional pane will open up presenting additional information. The
following content information is required:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation for code completions - this can come from a number
of different places and thus, should be extendible. Example extensions
would include doxygen style documentation, documentation databases, man
pages, etc.</li>
  <li>Preview of completion proposal - this would be for code templates
and virtual member function override to show what text will be inserted
at the cursor location.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance<br>
</h3>
<p>A key requirement on content assist is performance. A key benefit of
content assist is to speed up the creation of code content. If it takes
longer for the completion proposals to be calculate than it would to
type in the desired text, then this benefit is lost. The actual time
that would serve as this requirement is subjective, but a reasonable
initial stake would be a maximum of 3 seconds.<br>
</p>
<h2>Architectural Notes</h2>
<p>Clearly, the extension mechanism provided by the
SourceViewerConfiguration shall be used to implement a content
assistant. The CDT already provides an implementation of the content
assistant. Any changes must be co-ordinated carefully to ensure
existing functionality isn't compromised.<br>
</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>None at this time.<br>
