A common scenerio that users run into when starting to use the CDT is
how to bring existing source code into the Eclipse workspace. There are
a number of ways to this and the following are recommended approaches
for C/C++ projects.<br>
<br>
<div class="subsection">Create New Projects for Existing Source Roots</div>
<p>If the source is accessible to the user from thier desktop using the
command line then it is possible to simply make the root directories
containing that source as Eclipse projects. This is accomplished by
invoking the New Project Wizard, selecting C or C++ and then Standard
Make Project as the project type. On the next page, enter a name for
the project, the deselect the "Use Default Location" checkbox. This
will let you Browse to the root folder of the source tree. After
setting other information and clicking on Finish, the project will be
created in the root of the source folder you have selected.<br>
</p>
<p>The resource for the project are maintained in the remote location
specified, not in the workspace folder for eclipse. Meta data for the
project, such as the index for the project and the "link" to the
project, is stored in the metadata directory in the workspace folder.<br>
</p>
<div class="subsection">Create Project from CVS</div>
<p>If the existing source tree is managed in CVS, it is possible to use
the CVS Repository perspective to "Checkout As Project" any folder in
the repository. The first time this is done, a Simple Project is
created for the folder. To access the features of the CDT for this
project, the project must be converted to a C or C++ project using the
"Convert to a C or C++ Project" project type in the New Wizard.<br>
</p>
<p>This does a CVS checkout of the project into the project's location
(usually in the workspace). <br>
</p>
<div class="subsection">Import File System<br>
</div>
<p>Another approach would be to create the C/C++ Project and then do an
"Import"-&gt;"File System". This will make a copy of the files from the
selected location into the selected folder in the project. With the
copy, this approach is more wasteful and detaches the source from any
control mechanism that existed in the originaly file location (e.g. a
ClearCase view).<br>
