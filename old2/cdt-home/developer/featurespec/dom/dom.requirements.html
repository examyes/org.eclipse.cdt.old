<h1>CDT DOM Requirements</h1>
<h2>Features<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide syntactic and semantic information about the code in a
project</li>
  <li>Outline view</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Show major structural features in the current file (working
copy)</li>
    <li>Used for navigation into the file</li>
    <li>Also used to give overview of the contents of the file</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Search</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the ability to find references to
declarations/definitions</li>
    <li>Provide table of contents of declarations/definitions for the
project</li>
    <li>Provide declaration information about the code in the current
selection<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Content Assist</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide possible completions given the context of the current
cursor position</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Refactoring</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow for structural changes to the code while facilitating
checking to ensure semantics do not change</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Environment<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build Environment</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow features to work independent (as much as possible) of
build configuration</li>
    <ul>
      <li>users should not have to change configs to make elements of
the code visible in the model<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Allow features to work when the source files and the build are
at a remote location</li>
    <ul>
      <li>where no remote file system (e.g. NFS) or cross compilation
is available</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow features to work on large projects without disturbing
work flow</li>
    <ul>
      <li>regular edit/build/debug workflows should work the same
independent of project size</li>
      <li>performance should not degrade to the point where the
features do not work "reasonably" on large projects</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A typical large project would be 100,000 files with an average
of 500 characters per file stored in a slow file system (e.g. NFS)<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Idealy should handle larger, but this represents real
projects we've seen</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Languages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Support multiple C and C++ language variants</li>
    <li>Allow the adoption of this framework by other compiled language
IDEs</li>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g., Fortran, Ada, Cobol<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
