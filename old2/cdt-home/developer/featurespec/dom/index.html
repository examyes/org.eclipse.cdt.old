<h1>CDT DOM</h1>
<p>The CDT DOM will provide a complete code model for the source code
that can be used to analyze and refactor the code programmatically. The
DOM feature includes all components needed to build this code model
including the Scanner, Parser, Symbol Table, and Index. The objective
would be to move all current clients of the CDT parser to sit on top of
the DOM instead.</p>
