<h2>cdt.debug.ui</h2>
<p>
If there is more than one solution in the a to E columns, I've indicated my preference by using a black marquee. The original icon from R2.x is in the original column. Thank you so much for your help in refreshing this icon set.
<p>
If you could review each icon and raise any questions to me, regarding changes that I've made to bring this icon family more in line with the eclipse- Project/Tools components.
<p>Q: icons 85/86: is an H file the same as a 'heap' or a 'hash' file? Is it representative of a 'datapool'? 
<p>Q: what about an S file... is that a structure file or something else?
<p>Q: 27, 29, 30, 32-35, 37, 39, 46, 59, 65, I'm not sure how these icons are used and what they mean or represent?

<h3>Responses</h3>
<h4>Dave:</h4><pre>#13 should be A
#23 could we add the "target" to B?
#59 should be A, the suggested icon is too much like the link to active editor icon in the base.
#71 I prefer B
#75 I dislike all the choices (including the original :-)
#48 to #57 is the same as #101 to 110 --> I will look into why we have two...
</pre>
<h4>Thomas:</h4><p>
Some general comments from my look through the listings that I'll throw
out for comment ... if I didn't comment then I liked the new icon proposed:
<p>
#2 - Memory view, We should be consistent with the platform on this, but I don't really think that
a "can" is a better representation than a memory stick =;-) and it would collide with the current "header" representation proposed.
<p>
#4/#78,79 - Signals view/Signal toolbar
The same comments about signals in the debugger.
<p>
#13 - Arguments view,
I don't get it.
<p>
#15 - Environment,
Same comments as with the debug comments above.
<p>
#22 - Make,
As long as the representation falls in line with the build menu/target obj
icons
from above, I don't think that we can go wrong replacing the current icons.
<p>
How come the profile configuration and the tool configuration icons are the
same?

<h2>cdt.ui:</h2>
<p>
If you could review each icon and raise any questions to me, regarding changes that I've made to bring this icon family more in line with the eclipse- Project/Tools components.
Specifically I had some concerns about the following icons and the changes I've made:
library icons [3/58]
tool configuration icons [44-48/97-101]</p>

Q: 27, 29, 30, 32-35, 37, 39, 46, 59, 65, I'm not sure how these icons are used and what they mean or represent?
<p>
A:&nbsp; These are all used by the CDT debugger to represent stuff extracted from the executables

<h4>Bogdan:</h4><p>
95 - namespace, 
107 - struct,
110 - typedef,
112- union,
These are all used in the same context (CView, OpenType dialog) so it would make sense to adopt a similar style.&nbsp; I think that the originals are more appropriate.
<p>
85 - header file,
86 - header folder,
100 - assembler file,
Used in the same context as source files (57), should adopt similar convention.
<p>
111 - IProblem Marker.
Coloured orange on purpose - in order to match up to orange annotation.

<h4>Thomas:</h4><p>
Some general comments from my look through the listings that I'll throw
out for comment ... if I didn't comment then I liked the new icon proposed:
<p>
#26 - signal_obj -
&nbsp;I personally don't feel that the new icon represents a "signal" concept
which is an asynchronous communication into the program (hence the
"lightning").
I'm not tied to the lightning, but can we ask them to try again?
<p>
#28 - var_env -
&nbsp;I'm not a fan of the old icon, but at least it gave you an indication of
that it was an "environment" variable, the new one is just another dot.
<p>
#31 - var_pointer -
#38 - vard_pointer -
&nbsp;The new icon doesn't "feel" in line with the other variable icons.
I think that they were basing this on the same image/concept as the
instr_ptr (current instruction pointer used in the editor tray).
<p>
#49 - target_obj -
&nbsp;I really like the new icon(s).
<p>
#56 - build menu -
&nbsp;This is somewhat tied to the #49 and I think that iconographically it
would be nice to have a tie between them.&nbsp; Right now they are very distinct
<p>
#85 - hfile_obj -
#86 - hfolder_obj -
&nbsp;I don't think that the new icons are representative at all.&nbsp; I like the
concept of marking header files/folders the same as C/C++ files and folders.
This graphical representation doesn't mean anything (to me anyway).
<p>
#110 - typedef_obj -
#112 - union_obj -
&nbsp;I think that if enumerations are going to be marked with an E (which I
like)
then typedefs/unions should be marked similarly ... or at least similarly to

structs. The suggested icons don't map consistantly and since these items
are
"similar" then the iconography should also be similar (arguable point I'm
sure).

<h4>Mikhail:</h4><p>
#1, #2 Address breakpoint - I don't like the current one with "A", but I'm
not sure that the new image can be associated with an address breakpoint.
<p>
#6 org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/icons/full/obj16/disassembly_obj is no longer in
use.
<p>
#7 org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/icons/full/obj16/ is no longer in use.
<p>
#15, #16 images for shared libraries with or without debug information.
The new image is used for regular libraries. To indicate that library or
executable contains debug information it would be nice to have an overlay
image - the green bug, for instance, instead of "S".
<p>
#26 signal. I would prefer the old image.
