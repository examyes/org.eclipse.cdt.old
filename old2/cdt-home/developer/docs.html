suggestions, feedback, or unanswered questions, please send them to
the cdt-dev mailing list and we'll try to address them.</i></p>
<p>As the CDT begins to mature as a product and project and as the
number of parties interested in getting involved grows, it becomes
imperative that we lay out in writing the answers to two questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What does the CDT do and why?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the CDT do that and why?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The key factor in the above questions is “why”. As the
CDT grows in functionality, it is important that the integrity of big
picture is maintained. The CDT is built with specific goals in mind.
These are honorable goals aimed at making the CDT the best C/C++ IDE
on the planet (and off for that matter). These documents should
hopefully convey what “best” means so that new developers
can carry on the torch.</p>
<p>To help answer the two questions, the following two (or course)
documents are created.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/developer/featurespec/main.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project"><b>Feature
Specification</b></a><span style=""> – describes what the CDT does.
There are two main ways of describing features: first by describing the
visible components that the users sees, second by describing how the
user accompishes specific tasks. This spec does both.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Design Specification</b><span style=""> – describes how the
CDT does what it does. </span>It also describes the architectural
guidelines that should be followed by developers working on the CDT to
ensure we can stretch the CDT in new and exciting (yet not really
thought out yet) ways.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
