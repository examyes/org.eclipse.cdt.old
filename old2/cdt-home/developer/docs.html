<P><I><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Note</SPAN>: These documents
are in the very early stages of development. If you have any
suggestions, feedback, or unanswered questions, please send them to
the cdt-dev mailing list and we'll try to address them.</I></P>
<P>As the CDT begins to mature as a product and project and as the
number of parties interested in getting involved grows, it becomes
imperative that we lay out in writing the answers to two questions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>What does the CDT do and why?</P>
	<LI><P>How does the CDT do that and why?</P>
</UL>
<P>The key factor in the above questions is &ldquo;why&rdquo;. As the
CDT grows in functionality, it is important that the integrity of big
picture is maintained. The CDT is built with specific goals in mind.
These are honorable goals aimed at making the CDT the best C/C++ IDE
on the planet (and off for that matter). These documents should
hopefully convey what &ldquo;best&rdquo; means so that new developers
can carry on the torch.</P>
<P>To help answer the two questions, the following two (or course)
documents are created.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Feature Specification</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
	&ndash; describes what the CDT does. There are two main ways of
	describing features: first by describing the visible components that
	the users sees, second by describing how the user accompishes
	specific tasks. This spec does both.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P><B>Design Specification</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
	&ndash; describes how the CDT does what it does. </SPAN>It also
	describes the architectural guidelines that should be followed by
	developers working on the CDT to ensure we can stretch the CDT in
	new and exciting (yet not really thought out yet) ways.</P>
