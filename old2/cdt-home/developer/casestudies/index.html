<h1>CDT Case Studies</h1>
<p>In order to understand the areas in the CDT that need the most
attention, it is important to try the CDT on real projects. We will be
taking a look at a number of different scenarios and assessing the
performance and usability of the CDT in those scenarios. One of the
benefits of the huge number of open source C/C++ projects, is that we
have a lot of real projects to chose from. We also welcome teams that
are using the CDT for commercial projects that may wish to share their
experiences with the CDT.<br>
</p>
<p>The format of the case studies is a walkthough of a number of use
cases. Problems that are found with the CDT are raised with comments in
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red</span>. Note is made of the
CDT build and publish date and the case studies will be updated as
problems are fixed or new features introduced. The objective is to
publish these studies as user community tutorials once most of the
problems have been address. Of course, we expect users to find these
and use them as guides, which is perfectly fine as long as they read
the red comments as well :-)<br>
</p>
<p>Also note that by including certain open source projects, we are not
necessarily endorsing their use or guaranteeing their applicability in
any way. Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, here we go...<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This is an open source game
engine written in C++. This case study walks though importing the
source of the engine into a Standard Make project and walks through a
tutorial using a Managed Make project.<br>
