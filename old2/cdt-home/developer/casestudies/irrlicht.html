<h1>Irrlicht Tutorials - A CDT Case Study</h1>
<address>CDT 2.0 Final - July 7, 2004<br>
</address>
<p>The Irrlicht game engine is an open source game engine (<a
 href="http://irrclicht.sourceforge.net">irrlicht.sourceforge.net</a>)
written in C++. It takes advantage of C++ encapsulation and
polymorphism for extensibility. It also takes advantage of C++
templates to allow different data types to be used to specify vertices,
colors, etc. The engine supports both Linux and Windows and supports
both gnu and MSVC environments on Windows.</p>
<p>This case study walks through setting up irrlicht version 0.6 with
the mingw toolchain in a Standard Make project and then build and debug
the HelloWorld tutorial as a Managed Make project.<br>
</p>
<h2>The Irrlicht Engine</h2>
<p>The source code for the Irrlicht Engine is contained in a zip file
include with the distribution in the 'source' folder in 'source.zip'.
This source includes the source to the engine itself along with the
jpeglib and zlib libraries needed by the engine. To take advantage of
the build system that ships with the engine, we first create a C++
standard make project called irrlicht-0.6. Since we are running on
Windows we must set the binary parser to PE Windows <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(shouldn't this be the default when
creating a project on Windows)</span>. Also, once we import the source
for the engine, the index will be pretty useless until the discovery
feature can gather enough information. So we turn off indexing for now.<br>
</p>
<p>Once the project is created, the first thing we notice is that
Eclipse tried to build it. To prevent future long builds at inopportune
times, we turn of&nbsp; Ecilpse's build automatically feature <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(we really need to work with the
platform guys to define build behavior that would be suitable for both
Java and C/C++ projects)</span>. We can then use Eclipse's import zip
file feature to unzip the source.zip file into our project.<br>
</p>
<p>We now need to build the two included libraries. Jpeglib is
configure based so we need to open a shell on that directory using msys
and execute the configure command <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(now
here's an obvious enhancement request, make this a menu item on the
configure file that pops up a dialog that lets you specify options to
the configure command)</span>. We then go back to Eclipse and refresh
the jpeglib to get at the newly generated Makefile. To build using this
makefile, we select it and execute the Create Make Target command
accepting the default target 'all'. We can now build this library with
Build Make Target.<br>
</p>
<p>We now turn our focus to the zlib library. It has a pretty innocuous
makefile that we can use. First, however, we need to change the CC make
variable to point to 'gcc' since mingw doesn't create a 'cc. Then we
can Create Make Target and Build Make Target to get the library built.<br>
</p>
<p>The engine itself has two makefiles as well as project files for
Visual Studio and Dev-C++. The default Makefile is for building on
Linux and there is a Makefile.win which is generated from Dev-C++. The
Makefile.win is closes to what we need for building with mingw so we
rename Makefile to Makefile.linux and rename Makefile.win to Makefile.
The LIBS variable points to Dev-C++ directories so we change them to
point to the jpeglib and zlib directories in our project. We also
change the INCS and CXXINCS variable to point to the include directory
in our project and we add a space after the use of these variables in
the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS variables respectively.<br>
</p>
<p>When we first attempt to build the engine, we get a compile error in
CImageLoaderJPG.cpp. I'm not sure why, but it's there. Switching to the
Problems's view, we can see the error: "invalid conversion from 'u8" <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(this is a multi-line error with some
important info missing)</span>. We can double click on this error and
get to the offending line in the file. We see that we are trying to
assign one of our functions to a structure in the jpeglib library. We
can select 'fill_input_buffer' and hit F3 to find where we declare it. <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(actually selecting the
fill_input_buffer field of the jsrc variable brought us to our
fill_input_buffer instead of the jpeglib one I had expected)</span>.
Going up a few lines we see the definition of jsrc <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(selecting jsrc and hitting F3 should
have done this for us)</span>. Selecting jpeg_source_mgr and hitting F3
shows us that we should be using boolean, not u8. We can now go do our
declaration and change it, run the build again and fix the declaration
of our function to return boolean as well <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(change return type would be a good
refactoring)</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>Now that we can build, we can turn on the indexing.<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> (again, this takes a very long time
given that we don't really have around 450 files). (Searching for
references and declarations of fill_input_buffer never found the
definition of this function. This would have been handy when fixing the
compile error).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p>
<h2>Hello World Tutorial</h2>
<p>Now that the engine is built, we can try our hand at the tutorials.
We create a C++ Managed Make project called HelloWorld, for the
HelloWorld tutorial, and add the dependency on the irrlicht project.
Once created, we go to the properties on our new project and change the
include directories to point to the irrlicht/include directory <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(right now this has to be done using an
absolute path)</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(if you
forget to put the "include" in the path, and try to edit the entry
later, there is now Browse button)</span>. We then also add the
irrlicht directory to the library paths <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(again, absolute path)</span> and the
'Irrlicht' to our libraries list.<br>
</p>
<p>We now create a helloWorld.cpp file and enter the code from the
tutorial into it. We can take advantage of content assist on every
identifier if we so chose. We can also build as we go to check for
errors <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(turn off -Wall, it is
unreasonable to expect libraries to be clear of errors. It is a great
test of the error parsing, though)</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(the build console doesn't clear
between builds) (code completion doesn't complete things in nested
namespaces, e.g. irr::video::EDT_SOFTWARE, it completes fine if no
namespaces thanks to the usings). (Content assist is too slow - it
completes under 3 seconds but just) (Indexer causes the tools to
stammer a bit while running - likely due to gc). (There is too much
verbage in the build console. It's hard to see the commands I've run).</span><br>
</p>
<p>When specifying the paths to the sydney.md2 and sydney.bmp file,
simply specify them without a path. Then copy the files from the media
folder in the distribution to the project folder in Eclipse. When we
launch in the debugger, we'll be running in the project directory.<br>
</p>
<p>Once everything is set up, we can try out the executable we've
built. First we need to copy the irrlicht.dll from it's project
directory to the HelloWorld directory. This is necessary for Windows to
be able to find the DLL <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(There
should be a way to specify this in the launch config so that we don't
need to copy). </span>Create a launch configuration for the resulting
executable and watch the animation.<br>
</p>
Next, we want to debug the application and step into the game engine
code to see what it is doing. We debug the same launch configuration we
just created and the debugger stops at the first line in main. We can
try to step into the createDevice function to see what it does. It
doesn't because we haven't build the library with debug symbols. We go
back to the Makefile in the library project and add the -g flag to
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS and to the DLLWRAP command. In the outline view of
the Makefile, we can find the 'clean' target and create a make target
for it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(When you do Add Make
Target in the outline view, it creates the target and pops up a dialog.
If you like the defaults, you have to select Cancel, which is not
intuitive).</span> Run the clean target <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(After the clean, the CPU maxes out for
a minute or so.)</span> then run the all target <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(Again, the CPU maxed)</span>. Now we
have to copy the dll over to our tutorial project to get the right one <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(Again, error prone)</span>. Now start
up the debugger again and step into the createDevice method. Now step
into the constructor for CIrrDeviceWin32 method <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(I get an NPE when I do this and the
file 'include\irrstring.h' can not be found).</span> If we keep
stepping, we'll eventually get there and we can step through the
constructor. Try using F3 on the windows.h methods to find their
declaration. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(Things like
CreateWindow could not be found although HINSTANCE could).</span><br>
<br>
We stop there.<br>
