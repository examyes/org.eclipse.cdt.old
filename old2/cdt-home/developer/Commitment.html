<p class="MsoNormal">People often ask “what does it take to get involved with 
the development of the CDT?” There are many ways to get involved. On the 
lightweight end of scale, there is involvement by using the CDT and providing 
feedback and sharing your experiences on the Eclipse and CDT newsgroups. Beyond 
that, you can report problems that you discover, so that they may be addressed 
in future releases. A deeper level of involvement would be to actually solve 
some of the problems that you or others have uncovered by modifying/writing the 
necessary code and creating patches that can applied by the project committers. 
The final, and most beneficial way to get involved is to take responsibility for 
a significant piece of development work, whether it’s enhancing a particular 
area of the tool or creating new functionality. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this document is to help people and 
organizations understand what it means to “commit” to CDT Development at this 
highest level. Basically, it involves a commitment to describe, develop, test 
and document your contributions.</p>

<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH="100%">

<h2>Communicating Your Desires/Intentions</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first step involves letting the CDT user community and 
other CDT development team members what you propose. The mechanism for this is 
to create Bugzilla entries to describe the enhancements or new capabilities you 
propose to do. Bugzilla is the open source change management system used by 
Eclipse projects. To set these Bugzilla entries apart from other problem 
reports, the word “plan” should be used in the keywords field, and the severity 
of the entry should be set to “enhancement”. Following these guidelines will 
ensure that all of these proposals get picked up by the appropriate query and 
recorded in the plan for the upcoming release. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Feature specifications (what your code will do) and design 
specifications (how it will do it) are an important aspect of the development 
effort. These specifications will allow the CDT community and the rest of the 
CDT development team to understand what you are doing and to provide feedback. 
The format of these documents is not important, the content is.</p>
<h2>Delivering the Code</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the feature and design documents have been floated to 
the rest of the CDT community and feedback has been harvested, its time to start 
pushing the code changes into the development stream. For those that have 
committer privileges, these changes can be pushed directly into the stream. 
Those without committer privileges create patches that get reviewed and applied 
by committers. Patch requests are communicated via the ‘cdt-patch@eclipse.org’ 
mailing list. Being a committer entails certain responsibilities on its own 
which won’t be discussed here. For more information in what it means to be an 
Eclipse project or sub-project committer, see the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/eclipse-charter.html">Eclipse Project 
Charter</a>.&nbsp; We should point out that 
creating and submitting quality patches is the best way to obtain committer 
privileges for future work.</p>
<h1>Commitment To Testing</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone that contributes content to Eclipse projects is 
expected to test their contributions. When contributing a significant 
enhancement or feature, that commitment means more than just assuring the 
community that the code has been tested. It means documenting a test plan and 
committing to execute that testing on release candidate builds. The Eclipse way 
of generating releases is to generate a series of release candidate builds after 
all of the development has been completed. Each release candidate goes through a 
test-fix cycle where everyone tests their contributions and communicates their 
findings. A collective decision is made as to which problems will get fixed for 
the next release candidate, and the process is repeated. Fewer and fewer fixes 
will be “blessed” as we progress through the release candidates. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, committing to contribute significant code to the CDT 
also means committing to participate in the test-fix cycles by executing your 
test plans against the release candidates build leading up to the final release 
build.</p>
<h1>Commitment to Documentation</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">An important part of any enhancement or addition to the CDT 
is making sure that the on-line help of the tool stays current with the changes. 
The responsibility for updating/modifying/writing the on-line help content that 
is associated with some part of the tool lies with the contributors of the code. 
Unless the contributors have commit privileges, the on-line documentation 
content would get submitted as a patch, much the same as code. And, like code, 
producing and submitting quality documentation patches is the way to obtain 
documentation committer privileges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The 
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/cdt-home/user/docs.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">
CDT Documentation Style Guide</a>&nbsp; has been 
created to help maintain a constant look and feel for documentation originating 
from different contributors. There also a couple of links that take you to 
additional information on how to contribute help content for Eclipse projects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, finally, committing to contribute code to the CDT also 
means committing to contributing the associated on-line documentation content 
for the part of the tool that is being enhanced or created.</p>
