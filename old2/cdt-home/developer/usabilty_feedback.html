<p>
This document is the result of feedback obtained from an application developer's experiences in using CDT 1.1.  Bertina Lee used the CDT to develop a non-trivial C++ application in which MIDI files are parsed and converted to sheet music format.  Her feedback on CDT usability is offered as an informal study of both the major high points and the pitfalls of using the CDT for application development within the Eclipse framework.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that this study was done using CDT 1.1.  Some of the points below have been addressed as of the most recent development version, and comments of that nature have been added for clarification.</p>

<th>Area/Functionality</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Build on Save</td>
<td>Option to build on save and ability to turn this functionality on/off is nice.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Perspective concept</td>
<td>The CDT takes good advantage of the "perspective" concept that Eclipse uses.  Toggling between perspectives while coding allows one to quickly switch between a set of editing-related windows/views to a different set of debugging-related windows/views.  Also, the ability to customize and save perspectives is extremely useful.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Debugger</td>
<td>The debug perspective is very intuitive and extremely easy for a new user to work with.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Outline View</td>
<td>A very useful tool.  "Search for references" functionality is particularly useful when changing function parameters and doing refactoring.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Import/Export Wizards</td>
<td>Intuitive and easy to pick up.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Non-default Build Command</td>
<td>Being able to specify a non-default build command is nice.  However, there are some limitations - see pitfalls below for details.

<tr>
<td>Task Tags</td>
<td>No support for automatic TODO or FIXME task tags as in the JDT.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Build Abortion</td>
<td>There isn't currently a functioning method of aborting a build once it has been started.</td>
<td>[<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41752">41752</a>]</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Search/Replace</td>
<td>Search/Replace functionality currently does not support a tab delimiter.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Makefile Reliance</td>
<td>CDT 1.1: Unlike some other IDEs, the CDT component of Eclipse requires a Makefile in order to build a project.  No standard Makefile templates are given, so you have to learn how to write a Makefile in order to use the CDT.  Additionally, with the exception of editing it by hand, there is no way to update an existing Makefile within the CDT.
<p><b>NOTE: </b>This is currently being addressed in development versions of the CDT with the Managed Make Builder.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Code Completion</td>
<td>CDT 1.1: No support for automatic code completion as in the JDT.
<p><b>NOTE: </b>Code completion functionality is currently in development.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Non-default Build Commands</td>
<td>Non-default build commands are not handled well.  Non-default build commands are assumed to be targeted build tools with 'clean' and 'all' targets.</td>
<td>[<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25979">25979</a>]</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Refactoring</td>
<td>Currently no formal refactoring support as in the JDT.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Icons</td>
<td>No reference for the toolbar icons, etc. is available.  Perhaps a reference key should be available for users in the documentation with a clear explanation of the icon's meaning.</td>
