<p><b><a href="/cdt">C/C++ IDE</a></b>
The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a 
fully functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 
the Eclipse platform. Our focus is development on Linux for deployment on 
Linux, but we are interested in participation from others who would like 
to extend our work in other directions (e.g. a Windows client, targeting 
Unix(R) or embedded platforms, wizards for developing applications that 
use particular library or database or messaging APIs, or extension to 
other languages). We are looking for contributions from the open source 
community in the areas of testers, developers and general users who can 
help us ensure that the C/C++ tools work well on all the Eclipse platforms 
and compiler environments.
