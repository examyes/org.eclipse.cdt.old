<p>This page is dedicated to work
being done to add Gnu Ada (GNAT) support to the CDT. Let's call this
CDT Ada to start. I (this is Doug
Schaefer, BTW) am going to start this in a blog type format until we
get a sense of where we want to take this and start putting together
real plans and delivering stuff.</p>
<p>In some ways adding Ada support
to the CDT
is a test of the CDT's multi-language capability. It should be able to
help guide the architecture of the CDT to make it easier to add support
for new languages. However, this is also a sandbox for those interested
in
adding Ada support into the open source community of Eclipse.org to
dump their ideas, and eventually code.</p>
<p>Why do Ada? Well, for me (Doug
Schaefer), I've been a big fan of Ada since my university days where I
spent a lot of time learning new languages and programming models. My
main concern was finding the best languages to express various
programming solutions. The idea that one language can solve all your
problems is far from realistic. The language wars continue to fester
and really, the choice of which language to use for a given project,
belongs with the individual project teams that need to put together the
solutions.</p>
<p>In my case, I see Ada as an
excellent language for solving the problems it was meant to solve, i.e.
mission critical embedded systems. It has some of the strictest type
safety rules I've seen and has some of the coolest multi-tasking
programming mechanisms.</p>
<p>As an aside, I find it a little
funny that the Gnu Ada compiler itself is written mainly in Ada since
I'm not sure this application fits the original intent of the DoD, but
each to their own. But then I think that's one of the reasons it has
taken a long time to see Gnu Ada ported to new systems since they need
an Ada compiler to bootstrap.</p>
<p>So it concerns me when I read
and hear that Ada is becoming a dying language. A few years ago, DoD
removed the requirement that all software written for DoD contracts be
done in Ada. I need to research why they did that, but from what I
remember, it was mainly due to the costs of tooling and training. There
are very few Ada compilers on the market and even fewer IDEs for Ada.
With the rise of the open source movement, it is clear that if you want
your language to succeed in the big picture, you need to make the tools
freely available. That way, those students who want to learn a new
language have the tools available to try it out. Back in the 80's I
unfortunately did not get that opportunity to use Ada and so it never
made it to my programmers tool belt. The Gnu C and C++ compilers were
free and so that is what I ended up using the most.</p>
<p>In some ways, I'm hoping that
by putting together an IDE in open source for Ada, in combination with
the free Gnu Ada compiler that is now a part of most Linux
distributions and Cygwin, we can spark a bit of a revival for Ada</p>

<p>As a first step towards
supporting Ada in the CDT, I created an editor and associated it with
ads and adb files. This was&nbsp;a simple subclass of
AbstractDecoratedTextEditor. I then created a Standard Make project and
wrote a quick makefile that simply called gnatmake (which is pretty
much itself a managed builder). I then created a simple hello world Ada
program and did the build. As a pleasant surprise, whenever I had a
compile error out of the build the red X showed up in my editor on the
right line. That gave me a hint that I'm going to get a lot for free
out of this thing.</p>
<p>I then went on to look at debug
support. The first thing I wanted to do was set a breakpoint at the
Put_Line in my hello world program. Well, of course, that wasn't free
with my plain editor. However, as I found out when looking at how
breakpoints were set in the CEditor, it is a simple extension point
that hooks up the toggle breakpoint action to a new editor. Doing that,
I was able to get a breakpoint set on my Ada code. And thanks to the
multi-language abilities of gdb, I was able to fire up the debugger,
have my breakpoint hit, and have stack and variables from my Ada
program available in the debug views. And selecting my stack frame, the
right line gets highlighted in my Ada editor.</p>
<p>So the conclusion of that
activity, it appears that we should be able to reuse the CDT's build
and debug functionality with minimal changes.</p>
<p>So next, I started looking at
the CDT's core/UI functionality. While browsing through the CEditor, I
quickly got the feeling that there is a lot more to building an editor
than I though and that I needed to spend time building one to figure
out what all the pieces are. So I decided to continue with my Ada
editor and, while doing so, see if there are any large language
independent bits that aren't already part of the platform text editor
support that would be useful for other languages. That work is ongoing.</p>
<p>Also, we'll need to take a look
at the other core/UI features such as the CView, Search, Class Browser,
Type Hierarchy, etc. The main question I have here is whether we can
make the DOM and CModel extensible for other languages, or whether this
is worth it at all. To support this I'm building an Ada parser and Ada
DOM (largely because I love writing parsers). My current gut feel is
that, no, it won't be worth
it. There are a lot of concepts similar between different languages,
but the differences far outweigh the similarities. What I'd like to
achieve in the least is to reuse the UI components, such as the CView,
Class Browser, etc. We should only have on perspective for these
languages and a common set of views. The main use case I'd like to keep
clean is when a project has some Ada files and some C files and I want
to work on both in the same perspective without an explosion in the
number of views I have to work with.</p>

<p>So where can you help out? While I'm currently focusing on building
the Ada parser, I wouldn't mind seeing some work done on the
Search/Indexer side. Gnu Ada has a pretty cool cross reference and
searching tools, gnatxref and gnatfind. It would be cool to see if
these can be integrated into CDT Ada. I might also be able to use this
for the semantic analysis code in the DOM.</p>
<p>The Ada Editor could also use some upgrades. For example, while the
red X shows up on compile errors, you don't get the tool tip that shows
the error. There are also some handy editor actions for
commenting/uncommenting out code that the JDT and CDT have that could
be useful here. Fancier features like content assist and open
declaration need to wait for the DOM to support them.</p>
