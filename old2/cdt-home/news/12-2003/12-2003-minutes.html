<p>The following was discussed:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Update from participants:</b></li>

<p><u><b><br>QNX</b></u>:<p>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>In the midst of a product release which will be based on the CDT 1.2 stream, 
so busy fixing up 1.2 defects (mostly in the area of QNX-to-CDT integrations).<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have dedicated a resource to work on a class browser. This has been a 
proposed feature for the 2.0 release, and should be moved to the committed list 
of features for the release.<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Committing some resources to do debugger enhancements for the 2.0 release. 
Bugzilla entries for this (plan items - enhancements) should be created and 
tracked in the 2.0 release plan.<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thomas will create bugzilla entries for the list of Eclipse 3.0 catch-up 
items that has been generated.<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Working on some additional components that they will be in a position to 
push to the CDT once they get done with their upcoming product release. Since 
these are candidates for the 2.0 stream, bugzilla entries (enhancements) should 
be created for them and tracked in the 2.0 plan.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p><u><b>Redhat</b></u>: 
<ol>
  <li>Working on some features/capabilities that are secondary to the CDT 
  (secondary in that they are not PART of the CDT itself but must be added on 
  top). These features included a hover help plug-in, a profiling plug-in and 
  some others and will be ready within the next month or so.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><u><b>Intel</b></u>: Still in monitoring mode for now...<p><u><b>Rockwell:</b></u> 
  Still in monitoring mode for now...<p>&nbsp;<p>
<b>CDT 1.2.1 status:</b></li> </p>
  <p>Over 50 defects have been made to the 1.2 stream since it went GA back in 
  October 2003. The general concensus was that January 2004 was an appropriate 
  time to make 1.2.1 generally available. In the meantime, a 1.2.1 milestone 
  build will be made available before the end of the year so that users can pick 
  up the many defects that have been fixed so far. We will firm up a GA date at 
  the January CDT conference call scheduled for the first Wednesday in January 
  (January 7, 2004).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>CDT 2.0 Status:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The proposed Content Assist Enhancements feature has been to the 
    committed section of the 2.0 plan as IBM-Rational has committed the 
    resources for the associated development, testing and documentation.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>QNX has similarly committed to the Class Browser feature, and that 
    feature should be moved to the committed section as well.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>There were a couple of general questions about what it meant for a CDT 
    contributor to &quot;commit&quot; to a feature and thus have it moved from the 
    proposed section of the plan to the committed section. The answer is that 
    committing means committing to develop, test and document the feature. A 
    note will be posted to the cdt-dev mailing list re-iterating this so that is 
    clear for everyone.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>During the recent CDT 2.0 kick-off in November, a multitude of potential 
    usability enhancements were discussed and proposed. A proposed plan item was 
    subsequently created in bugzilla that captured the shopping list. 
    IBM-Rational will be taking on a small number of these enhancements, and 
    will be creating a scaled down bugzilla plan item to put in the committed 
    section of the 2.0 plan. <i><b>There are a bunch of really good ideas still 
    left in that shopping list that provide a great opportunity for other 
    contributors to pick up and get involved!</b></i><p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>CDT M5 has been achieved a few days after the Eclipse project reached M5 
    on the Eclipse 3.0 release.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
<b>Documentation</b></li> </p>

<p>The re-structuring of the documentation (on-line help) has been completed so 
that all contributors can contribute to the documentation by submitting patches 
(same process as for submitting code changes). An announcement of this will soon 
be posted to the appropriate mailing lists along with a style guide that can 
help documentation contributors maintain consistency across the docs.<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
<b>Verification/Bugs</b></li>:</p>
  <p>Not much to discuss here since we are in the early stages of the 2.0 
  release.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Infrastructure/Builds</b></li>:<p>The automation of the regular builds is 
  broken :-(<p>One build (the M5 build) has been already done, and another will 
  be manually done in December (likely on the M6 build from Eclipse). Doug 
  Schaefer is looking into what's causing the trouble and how to get the 
  automated builds back up and running again.<br>&nbsp;
  <p>Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome! As always, many thanks
to everyone for your ongoing support.&nbsp;<!-- Footer --> </p>
