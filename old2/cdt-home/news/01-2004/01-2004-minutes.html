<p>The following was discussed:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Update from participants:</b></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>QNX</b>:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>QNX have cut over to a 1.2.1 build (their own build) as part testing their 
upcoming release. Testing going well, would be happy with a 1.2.1 GA build 
anytime.<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hoping to have a 1st cut at a proposal for the hierarchy view (class 
browser) feature in the next week.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;<p><u><b>IBM-Rational:</b></u><ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Continue to work on 2.0 features and helping with fixing and 
  committing patches that address 1.2 issues.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;In the middle of creating design specs for all 2.0 feature work, 
  will be done by end of January.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some Content Assist now in the M6 build, should be finishing up near the 
  M7 build.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The on-line documention activities are being taken over by a different 
  IBM-Rational person, Angelina Gomes. We welcome Angelina on board and look 
  forward to working with her when she becomes assigned to this new task in 
  Mid-February. A thank you also to Tanya-Marise De Sousa who has been handling 
  these activities over the course of the 1.2 stream.</li>
  </ol>

<p><u><b>Redhat</b></u>: 
<ol>
  <li>Continuing work on hover help and profiling plugins, should be ready to 
  commit very soon. A question came up about how the hover help will be 
  structured given that its a little RedHat/Linux specific; the answer was that 
  it will be in a separate plug in that it not part of the base CDT.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Internal planning for 2004 being wrapped up, should have a clearer picture 
  w.r.t. to CDT activities in 2004 soon.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;<p><u><b>Altera:</b></u> Working on a product prototype based on CDT 
  1.2<p>&nbsp;<p><u><b>Intel</b></u>: No new update...<p>&nbsp;<p><u><b>Real 
  Time Innovations:</b></u> Keeping themselves informed of CDT developments<p>&nbsp;<p>
<b>CDT 1.2.1 status:</b></li> </p>
  <p>Continuing to find and fix some issues on the 1.2.1 RC1 build, but nothing 
  worth holding off doing a GA build for wider adoption. A target was set for 
  doing another release candidate build at the end of the following week 
  (January 16, 2004).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>CDT 2.0 Status:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The proposed <u><b>Managed Build Enhancements</b></u> feature will be been to the 
    committed section of the 2.0 plan as IBM-Rational has committed the 
    resources for the associated development, testing and documentation. See the
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/cdt-home/plans/CDT_R2.0_plan.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">
    CDT 2.0 Plan</a> for more details.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>We need to setup inbox mail accounts to help us better triage incoming 
    defects, along the lines of what the Eclipse project does. Kleo has taken 
    the action to request this via Webmaster, highlighting that this was 
    discussed and agreed upon at the CDT monthly conference calls.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eclipse Conference coming up first week of February 2004. Several folks 
    from QNX, IBM, Intel, RTI and possibly others will be attending. CDT 
    specific highlights will include a presentation/demonstration and also a &quot;<i>birds 
    of a feather&quot; </i>session.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
<b>Documentation</b></li> </p>

<p>As mentioned, Angelina Gomes is the new contact point for CDT documentation, 
taking over for Tanya-Marise De Sousa. Angeline will not be active in this role 
until approximately mid-February 2004. She will be monitoring the documentation 
mailing list and participating in some CDT design proposal meetings in the 
meantime in an effort to get up to speed as quickly as possible.<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
<b>Verification/Bugs</b></li>:</p>
  <p>Not much to discuss here since we are in the early stages of the 2.0 
  release.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Infrastructure/Builds</b></li>:<p>The CDT 2.0 automated build issues have 
  been resolved, we are generating regular 2.0 builds again. </p>
  <p><br>&nbsp;
  <p>Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome! As always, many thanks
to everyone for your ongoing support.&nbsp;<!-- Footer --> </p>
