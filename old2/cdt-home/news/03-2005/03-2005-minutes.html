<LI>QNX – Derrick, Thomas, Alain, Mikhail, James, Seb, Chris
</UL>

<H3>CDT 2.03</H3>
<UL>
<LI>We are still waiting to see if there is any other fixes. We are pretty 
much there unless someone identifies an issue that needs to be fixes. We’re 
holding off a bit because we want to avoid a 2.04
</UL> 

<H3>CDT 2.1.1</H3>
<UL>
<LI>There was a managed build issue raised. As far as Leo (Intel) is 
  concerned it not appropriate to fix it for 211. 
<LI>Open Type Stack Overflow is last outstanding issue
<LI>Doug (IBM) waiting for the ok from Alain (QNX) before spinning build
</UL>


<H3>CDT 3.0</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Milestone 5 is over, no more feedback is coming
<LI>Derrick (QNX) sent out a plea to have people actually read
  and update the status of plan items:
  <UL>
  <LI>Indicate if you are working on something and it is "committed"
  <LI>Indicate if you are working on something and it is "proposed"
  </UL>
<LI>Derrick indicated all should review the plan so that we
  can make a plan and update for Milestone 6 instead of 7
<LI>M5 should be built March 14th for initial testing
	<UL>
  	<LI>Results will be posted to the newsgroup (cdt-test)
  	</UL>
<LI>M5 go-no criteria before posting as stable
  <UL>
  <LI>Sanity testing of features (1 day activity)
    <UL>
    <LI>Formally done by James Tan (QNX) (who may be absent =;-)
    <LI>Committers encouraged to help informally
    </UL>
  <LI>Feature testing of features (1 day activity)  <LI>Red flag any items that were marked for M5 that are not present
  <LI>Red flag any items that were committed but not working
  </UL>
<LI><b>The branch is "slushy" at this time so no commits of large
    destabilizing features.</b>
<LI>Additional participants/resources requested to help with the 
  scalability testing by Mathieu (IBM)

<LI>Doug (IBM) committed to having ISV docs built for the M5 build
  <UL>
  <LI>John (IBM) indicated the DOM docs are in good shape
  <LI>Alain (QNX) indicated that there is a fair amount of javadoc
    in place for the debug interfaces, but there may be some changes
    coming along with WindRiver and their debug issues. For 3.0 the
    CDI javadocs will be up to date.
  </UL>
</UL>

<H3>CDT 3.x</H3>
<UL
<li>IBM has identified the need for a release for Q4 of 2005.  Likely
  a bug fixing effort.
<LI>Leo (Intel) & Chris (TI) both indicated that they have features
  that they will expect to have come up for that timeframe (MBS)
</UL>

<H3>Eclipse Con Review</H3>
<UL>
<LI>WindRiver is hosting a top level Device Software Project as a 
  strategic developers:
  <UL>
  <LI>Also interested in enhancing CDT: additional requirements/new features
  <LI>General areas include debugging (CDT & Platform), 
    parsing/static analysis (WR technology), managed build 
    capabilities (language agnostic)

  <LI>Rooney (WRS) mentioned that the focus will be on remote target 
    management (data models and functionality).
  <LI>Montavista's target proposal will likely shift to this project.
  </UL>
<LI>Look forward to much news and background about this showing up
  on the Eclipse.org/CDT mailing list.

<LI>Many discussions about the debugger (CDT and platform) API and 
  frameworks and how to go forward to make changes.  There will 
  likely be a meeting in Toronto in the next few weeks (as a post
  3.0 activity).
</UL>

<H3>LDT Project</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Lots of discussion around multi-language development, specifically
  the way that the Fortran project(s) have built off of the CDT as
  an example.  There may be parts of CDT that are applicable to this
  project.
<LI>No official involvement yet, some confusion around what the LDT
  project is going to go short term.
<LI>CDT could be positioned as a better solution for some clients who
  might be considering the LDT but are waiting for a solution.
</UL>

<H3>Fortran/Core Plugin Replacement</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Current discussion/proposal on how the Fortran code can easily 
  replace the calls to CCore.getDefault() for accessing the Core Model.
<LI>Brian (??) indicated that there doesn't appear to be a clear solution 
  on where this cut would occur.  It was proposed that it might be 
  worthwhile to use the MBS as a candidate for this first "language 
  agnostic" component.
<LI>Leo (Intel) indicated that his plate is pretty full for CDT 3.0 and
  that there won't be time for exploring this, but that contributions
  are welcome.
<LI>For the short term, the Fortran "folks" are going to have to do the 
  initial probing to figure out how to make this go.
</UL>
