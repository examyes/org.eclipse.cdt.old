<p>The following was discussed:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Update from participants:</b></li>

<p><u><b><br>QNX</b></u>: Focused on CDT 1.2, running a little bit behind 
schedule due to summertime vacation issues.

<p><u><b>Redhat</b></u>: Approaching final delivery on their product(s) which 
have a mid-September code freeze milestone. Once product has been delivered, 
will start to increase their CDT participation level.<p><u><b>Intel</b></u>: 
Interested in adding simulator support into the eclipse framework &amp; integrating 
that with the CDT. That will be their focus over the upcoming weeks.<p><u><b>
Timesys:</b></u> Planning on a product release end of Q3 2003 based on Eclipse 
2.1 &amp; CDT 1.1. They are following progress on the 1.2 release of the CDT and 
will start to look at it in greater detail once the release is out.<p><u><b>
Altera:</b></u>&nbsp; Closely following the 1.2 development and evaluating the 
build mechanisms in particular. Hoping to be in a position to contribute soon.<br>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;<li>
<b>CDT 1.2 status:</b></li>
<p>The CDT 1.2 release is slipping by a couple of weeks, mostly due to vacation 
issues and unforeseen absences. The updated plan calls for a feature freeze by 
Sept 19, code freeze at the end of September and a release date of Oct. 14.<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Other Frameworks/Features:</b><p>Sebastien discussed the current efforts to 
define an &quot;embedded roadmap&quot; for Eclipse. The topic is on the agenda for the 
upcoming Eclipse board meeting. One of the things that the people involved are 
currently looking to do is identify issues at the Eclipse platform level that 
would need to be addressed in order to move towards an embedded solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<li>
<b>Infrastructure/Builds</b></li>

<p>The regular builds are now completely automatic (including execution of the 
JUnit tests) and are being run nightly (weekday nights only). The IBM Rational 
team is doing manual sanity (on a weekly basis) and is posting the results to 
the CDT Dev list.<p>The CDT downloads page has updated to better reflect the 
state of the regular builds and to point out the mechanism for obtaining them.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Documentation</b></li>

<p>Most of CDT on-line documention (User's Guide) is ready. A review will be 
held around mid September in order to provide enough time to recover as much 
feedback as possible before the Freeze milestone on Oct. 1. Direct participation 
in the review or providing off-line feedback on the docs would be highly 
appreciated.<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Verification/Bugs</b></li>:<p>Not discussed at any length as a separate forum 
has been established just for that. Interested parties can subscribe to the &quot;cdt-test-dev&quot; 
mailing list to keep abreast of the details in this area.<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Varia:</b></li>

<p>There was a discussion on the managed build feature, highlighting that 
significant effort is required to package it up in a separate plugin. The plugin 
has been created, and Sean Evoy will meet with the appropriate folks from QNX 
with the goal of having the extractions completed by the end of next week.<p>The 
topic of CDT 2.0 planning was brought up, with the major theme being that the 
right timeframe for starting to discuss and plan the release is now. It was 
suggested that we should start to have some plans in place for the end of 
October. All agreed that the discussions (via the mailing list) should start to 
happen ASAP.</ol>
Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome! As always, many thanks
to everyone for your ongoing support.&nbsp;<!-- Footer -->
