<p>The following was discussed:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Update from participants:</b></li>

<p><br>Cory and Sebastien discussed the "evangilism" efforts for CDT. Core
mentionned that Rational had been in to present the CDT to the Nortel tools
group. Nortel is interested in getting involved with Eclipse, and might
consider joining the board. Sebastien met with a few other companies interested
in participating with CDT -- Lauterbach, Tremento and Altera. Altera has
since started "getting their hands dirty" with CDT and is asking questions
in the mailing lists.
<p>Redhat&nbsp; discussed their CDT activities. Jeremy Handcock has joined
the effort; Jeremy will be doing testing for the CDT. Redhat also has Martina
using the CDT for real application development, and will provide usability
feedback. Redhat's product plans are still focussed on a server offering,
and they still have other value-add plugins in the works (profiling, RPM).
Timesys will be releasing an update to TimeStorm shortly (2.1), with bugfixes
to the base CDT. Timesys is also planning TimeStorm 2.2, which will be
based on Eclipse 2.1 and CDT 1.1. Thomas mentionned that QNX is currently
gathering usability feedback from customers, and hope to provide some information
back to the group shortly.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>CDT 1.2 status:</b></li>

<p><br>Now that CDT 1.1 is GA, work has started on CDT 1.2. Based on user
feedback and the CDT wish list, the scope for 1.2 is larger than originally
anticipated. Because of that, a September release appears more realistic.
Kleo has circulated a feature and timeline proposal for CDT 1.2 on the
mailing list -- this proposal need to also incorporate the debug items,
and will then be posted on the web site for approval.
<p>As for additional CDT 1.2 items (beyond Kleo's proposal), Thomas mentionned
that there was some clean-up needed in the CView to bring it up to the
Eclipse 2.1 base level. This is work that Thomas has started, and will
likely complete (with some help) in a 1.2 timeframe.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>CDT 2.0</b></li>

<p><br>CDT 2.0 was discussed. The main requirements for the 2.0 release
include nailing down to APIs of the core model, the calbacks, the parser,
the DOM, the build mode and the CDI debug interfaces. These APIs have to
not only be stable, but also be documented to allow ISV's to produce integrations
with CDT. Further, significant work on the DOM is still needed. Due to
the scope of 2.0, the GA release was tentatively planned as Q1/2004.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Test/Verification</b></li>

<p><br>&nbsp;Various items were discussed, including assesing the current
coverage, as well as producing a test plan framework. The CDT verification
group at Rational is working on an initial test plan, which they will present
at a CDT testing meeting later this month. Some of the areas Rational is
looking at includes non-functional aspects, such as scalability. We also
discussed automated JUnit testing, and having that be part of the builds.
<p>The automated UI testing topic was deferred again. This will be discussed
in the CDT testing meeting Rational is setting up.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Infrastructure/Builds</b></li>

<p><br>Doug has completed his automated builds and upload, and has also
worked through the versioning aspects by using a minor/minor version numbers
in the plugins between major releases (e.g. CDT 1.2.0.2). The builds use
the update site and allow CDT users to automatically install the latest
CDT builds. The frequency of builds was discussed, with twice to three
times a week being agreed upon as "often enough".
<p>Another topic was discussed - the ability for the JUnit tests to be
run as part of the build, with the results posted on the CDT web site.
There was discussion about the plugin the releng folks use for the main
Eclipse builds; also, Peter Graves has done some work to automate the build/test/produce
html cycle, and will post his scripts as a starting point.
<p>Finally, the web site was discussed. This is in need of an overhaul,
both in organization and content. Sebastien will be driving that over the
next few months.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Documentation</b></li>

<p><br>QNX is going to put up its raw content into the doc plugin this
week, which Rational will use as a starting point for the CDT user's manual.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Bugs</b></li>

<p><br>The bugzilla database was dicsussed. This still contains a lot of
bugs from the old CDT codebase, as well as categories which are no longer
relevant. As a first step, Sebastien and Kleo will go through the bug list
and close those bugs which applied to the old CDT. This is expected to
shrink the CDT bug list by close to 100. As well, we will create new categories
and versions that are in line with our new CDT features and releases.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Varia:</b></li>

<p><br>The target model was discussed. Thomas put out his target model
proposal, other CDT participants will provide feedback. There was also
discussion of article opportunities; Sebastien and Doug are writing an
article on CDT for C/C++ User's Journal, while Gene from Timesys is writing
a "creating your first plugin" intro article.</ol>
Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome! As always, many thanks
to everyone for your ongoing support.&nbsp;<!-- Footer -->
