</p>
<h3>Release Planning</h3>
<h4>CDT 2.0.2<br>
</h4>
CDT 2.0.2 is ready to put in the bag. It addresses a small handfull of
severe bugs found in 2.0.1.<br>
<h4>CDT 2.1</h4>
<p>CDT 2.1 will target code freeze by the end of October. This means
that RC0 will be built on Tuesday, November 2. We will spin release
candidates weekly until we are convince there are no severe bugs
remaining.<br>
</p>
<p>QNX is focused mainly on debugger work and upgrading the editors to
take advantage of Eclipse 3.0 features.<br>
</p>
<p>Intel will contribute some of their work on managed build for 2.1
including the new model including file level settings and support for
old extensions.<br>
</p>
<h4>CDT 3.0</h4>
<p>Everyone agreed that targeting "close to sync" deliver with Eclipse
3.1 in 2Q05 is acceptable.<br>
</p>
<h3>Community Updates</h3>
<p>QNX and Intel talked about their 2.1 deliverables. (see above)<br>
</p>
<h4>MontaVista</h4>
<p>Still considering the remote system model (ed. called target model
at one point but this is a much better name). This will likely be a
post 2.1 thing.<br>
</p>
<h4>TimeSys</h4>
<p>Waiting on 2.0.2 and the remote system model work.<br>
</p>
<h4>TI</h4>
<p>Interested in session for embedded development at EclipseCon.<br>
</p>
<h4>Red Hat</h4>
<p>Eclipse to be part of Update 3 for RHEL. Working on cdt-contrib
plugins including hover help, oprofile integration, and a new ChangeLog
plugin.<br>
</p>
<h4>HP</h4>
<p>Working on HP-UX port. Waiting for remote debugging story for
servers.<br>
</p>
<h4>Wind River</h4>
<p>Announced intent to contribute to the CDT core in the area of
refactoring support. The team from Salzburg, Austria will be
participating.<br>
</p>
<h4>IBM</h4>
<p>Working on parser architecture improvements including definition of
