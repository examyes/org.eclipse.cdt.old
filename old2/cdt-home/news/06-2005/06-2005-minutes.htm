<h2>CDT 3.0 </h2>
<h3>review schedule:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Project plan is now update with latest dates. </li>
  <li>The milestone plan has been updated; more updates have been received from 
    Leo and Chris and will be applied. </li>
  <li>If anyone else has changes please post them to the news group. There was 
    some discussion about images files for CDT. There are a few that are of the 
    old vintage. If replacements are not ready by M7 then they will ship as is. 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy for final release: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Bugzilla: No Open PRs against 3.0 at time of final release. </li>
  <li> Bugzilla: needs to be updated so that it reflects the issues we intend 
    to fix for final release. Committers should also review the In box by end 
    of Day Friday June 3. After that all inbox items will be moved forward. </li>
  <li>Bugzilla: If anyone would like to fix an issue, let the mailbox owner now. 
    Don't be shy we encourage this type of behavior. </li>
  <li>Bugzilla: Any issues we intend to fix should have a milestone target set. 
    This will give us a baseline of the issues we intend to fix for final release.</li>
  <li> Planning: In order to help facilitate progress we decided that having a 
    project call every two weeks would be useful. The call-in information is the 
    same as our monthly call. The dates and times are as follows: 
    <ul>
      <li> June 9, 2005, 13:00 EDT </li>
      <li>June 23, 2005, 13:00 EDT </li>
      <li>July 7, 2005, 13:00 EDT </li>
      <li>July 21, 2005, 13:00 EDT </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Planning: For RC7 it was decided that we would go to the latest Eclipse 
    RC that is available at the time of RC7. It was noted that there are issues 
    with the current release, but these do not prevent us from moving to it. Any 
    platform issues need to be reported and prioritized accordingly. </li>
  <li>Testing: QNX, IBM, Intel and Symbian shared their plans for testing. Most 
    testing will be focused on the features each participant plans to deliver 
    and will be unstructured in nature. James will continue to run the sanity 
    testing after each milestone build and make the results available. </li>
  <li>Documentation: The committers were asked to review the documentation for 
    their respective areas of responsibility in order to assess how up to date 
    it is. Please post your observations; this will give us an idea of the state 
    of our docs. Please do this asap as all content for doc update will be required 
    in the next three weeks Due: June 30, 2005 </li>
  <li>Documentation: QNX will have their Tech editors review the content once 
    submitted. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Plan next 12 months </h2>
<h3>CDT 3.1? roughly December/05 time frame </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Deferred items from Manage Build will be considered for this release. </li>
  <li>A top level Plan will be checked into CVS (Derrick) </li>
  <li>It was noted that not all committers have access to the docs yet. Derrick 
    will follow-up. </li>
  <li> The plan will also be posted to the wiki. This will allow people to edit 
    it in the mean time. </li>
</ul>
<h2>CDT fall conference</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Please respond to the thread already posted in the news group. </li>

    of content. </li>
  <li>There seems to be plenty of interest and enthusiasm, now we just need to 
    hammer out what it is we want to cover. </li>
