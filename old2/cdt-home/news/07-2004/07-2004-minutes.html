<p><b><i>July7, 2004</i></b>
<p>Phone in meeting of Eclipse CDT stakeholders. Review progress to date
and map out the future direction for the Eclipse CDT Project.

<a <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/cdt-home/news/07-2004/07-2004-notice.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">Agenda</a></b><p>&nbsp;<p><b>
<font size="3">Minutes</font></b><font size="3"> </font>
<br>&nbsp;<p>Here are the minutes of the CDT conference call.
<br>&nbsp;<p><b><font size="3">Present:</font></b><font size="3"> </font>
<p><b>QNX, IBM-Rational, RedHat, Intel,  MontaVista, 
Texas Instruments, Rockwell, WindRiver</b><p>&nbsp;<p>
<b><font size="3">Update from participants:</font></b><font size="3"></li>
</font> </p>
<p><u><b>QNX</b>:</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Starting to work on debugger enhancements to catch up to Eclipse 3.0 that 
did not make it into CDT 2.0, and also on some managed build system 
generalizations. This is feature work and will be delivered in the HEAD stream 
for release 2.1. This work WILL cause API churn.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><u><b>IBM-Rational:</b></u><ol>
  <li>Working on performance improvements and other defects that are required 
  for a 2.0 maintenance release. Next CDT based product release (fall 2004) will 
  be based on the 2.0 maintenance release.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Will continue with testing of 2.0 and 2.0.1 stream, especially in areas 
  not rigorously tested by us to date.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>

          <p><u><b>Rockwell:</b></u><ol>
            <li>Still working on getting corporate approval&nbsp; to contribute 
            to open source and the CDT project.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Doing some plug-in development that they would like to 
            contribute (pending approval) in the areas of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - C++ code formatter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - PC Link Integration<br>
&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Availability of ClearCase plugin for Eclipse 3.0 (due Sept. 
            2004) gating internal adoption of Eclipse 3.0 and CDT 2.0<br>
&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>
        <p><u><b>Texas Instruments:</b></u><ol>
          <li>Concentrating on product due to ship this fall, based on CDT 2.0. 
          Will be keeping an eye on the 2.0 maintenance stream and 2.0.1 release 
          to gauge wether or not to pick some fixed up or stick with 2.0.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>

<p><u><b>Redhat</b></u>: 
<ol>
  <li>Awating resolutin of how &amp; where to contribute RPM and Profiling plugins 
  that have been developed.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Working CDT 2.0 into next product release schedule for August 2004<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <p><u><b>Intel</b></u>:<ol>
    <li>Have proposed some managed build enhancements and are looking to work 
    with community to implement them.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Have raised some error parser issues that should be resolved, not 
    necessarily in the 2.0 maintenance stream but definitely for a subsequent 
    release.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
      <p><u><b>MontaVista:</b></u><ol>
        <li>Moving forward to CDT 2.0 internally<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b><u>Wind River</u>:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Looking at CDT 2.0 and comparing capability with their previous IDE 
  (Eclipse 2.x based).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Interested in additional functionality &amp; looking to collaborate on 
  Refactoring and Managed Build enhancements</li>
  </ol>
              <p>&nbsp;<p><b><font size="3">CDT 2.0 Maintenance Stream Plan &amp; 
  Process :</font></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>General agreement that the 2.0 branch should stay frozen from an API 
    perspective and remain backwards compatible.</li>
    <li>Defect fixing only, and all commits to the branch should reference the 
    defects being addressed by the changes.</li>
    <li>All defects that will be fixed in the 2.0 branch should have the 
    Bugzilla target_milestone field set to 2.0.1</li>
    <li><b><i>Any potential API changes/breaks should be communicated and 
    discussed within the community PRIOR to committing them.</i></b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
<b><font size="3">CDT 2.1 Content &amp; Timing</font></b></p>

              <ul>
                <li>To help the CDT community plan for on-going releases, it was 
                proposed that the community should put in place a formal 
                planning exercise on a six month cycle.</li>
                <li>Current view is that a 2.1 release would be required by the 
                end of October, primarily in support of a QNX product release.</li>
                <li>Outside of the formal 6-month planning session, plans should 
                be captured and discussed using Bugzilla plan items. Each of 
                these plan items should capture what is being proposed and when 
                it is expected to be delivered.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
<b><font size="3">Contributing RPM and Profiling Plugins (Red Hat)</font></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 possibilities were proposed: a) create a separate project or b) create 
    a new CDT component with the Red Hat contributors set up as the initial 
    committers. It was felt that creating a separate project for this is too 
    heavyweight, so it was agreed to proceed with option b.</li>
    <li>Sebastien Marineau will formally request the creation of the new 
    component.</li>
    <li>As with the CppUnit, these plugins will be hosted on the CDT community 
    page, not on the main download page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
<b><font size="3">Managed Build system proposal</font></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many CDT participants are interested in generalizing the managed build 
    system so that we can all share it as much as possible and avoid each 
    company doing their own. Several proposals have been made along the way. 
    Sean Evoy, who has been quarterbacking most of the work done to date on MB 
    will set up a meeting within the next couple of weeks with the goal of 
    identifying and assigning specific pieces of work to help achieve this goal. 
    Stay tuned to the <a href="mailto:cdt-dev@eclipse.org">cdt-dev@eclipse.org</a> 
    mailing list for more information on this.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p><b><font size="3">Error Parser issues</font></b><ul>
      <li>Intel has proposed to fix several error parser issues (Bugzilla items: 
      65576, 66762, 66808). Alain Magloire at QNX has some additional 
      suggestions and will work with Intel on getting this stuff implemented. It 
      is not required for the 2.0 maintenance branch, although there is one 
      piece of low hanging fruit that could be addressed on the maintenance 
      branch (restoring defaults).</li>
      </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome! As always, many thanks
to everyone for your ongoing support.&nbsp;<!-- Footer --> </p>
