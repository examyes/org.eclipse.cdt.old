<p><b><i>November 12, Ottawa Canada</i></b>
<p>Version 2.0 of the CDT was officially kicked off when contributors, users and 
other interested parties gathered in Ottawa on November 12 to share experiences, 
discuss plans and bounce around ideas on how to take the CDT up another notch. 
The large attendance in the meeting and the general enthusiasm of everyone 
certainly set the tone for great things to come from the CDT world!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Below is the list of people that attended the meeting. My apologies to 
anyone else that may have dialed into the conference, I was not able to capture 
all of those names as people were coming and going on the bridge throughout the

  <li>Steve Saunders, the Ottawa Lab director (IBM-Rational) welcomed everyone 
  and expressed both his amazement and pleasure at the level of participation 
  that this meeting had created, recalling how much smaller the 1.0 kickoff

  <li>John Duimovich of IBM addressed the gathering with a high level update 
  from the Eclipse Tools Project, talked briefly about how far the CDT 
  sub-project had come and provided some guidance for what it would take to get 
  the CDT to the next level: namely, active participation and contribution from 
  all of the companies gathered for the meeting.</li>

  <li>Kleo Hapitas gave a brief presentation proposing that the CDT project 
  adopt the milestone based development process and end-game process utilized by 
  the Eclipse Project. Following the presentation, all of the participants 
  agreed that it made sense to do so and agreed to adopting it for the CDT 2.0 
  release. 
<ul style="margin-bottom: 4">
  <li>Also discussed was the migration from the 2.1.x version of the Eclipse 
  Framework to the new 3.0 version. It was proposed that the regular CDT 2.0 
  builds be cut over to the Eclipse 3.0 framework as soon as the M5 driver was 
  available (Nov. 21). It was agreed that we needed to do that in order to start 
  making use of the new features being delivered in the 3.0 release of Eclipse, 
  even though it means we would not be able to maintain backwards compatibility 
  with 2.x versions of Eclipse. There were no objections to attempting to cut 
  over to Eclipse 3.0 as soon as the M5 driver is available.</li>
  <li>A final point of discussion was the timeframe for releasing a maintenance 
  release on the 1.2 stream. It was proposed that this be done late this year 
  (December) or early next year (January), unless some participants had other 
  needs. None were brought up, so the plan remains the same. A more concrete 
  timeframe will have to be ironed out in the upcomin CDT conference call(s).</li>

<ul>
  <li>Following the breakout sessions, the participants gathered back together 
  for a wrap-up. Many ideas and proposals for ways to move forward were 
  discussed during the break out sessions, and at the end it was agreed that 
  each of the proposals should be captured in a bugzilla entry (similar to how 
  the Eclipse project team capture their proposals). A meeting will be organized 
  in late November or early December to review all of the proposed work items 
  and to see which ones can be committed to. It was further agreed that in order 
  for a feature or enhancement to make it into the release, there has to be 
  commitment to not only develop it, but also to test it and document it. That 
  commitment does not necessarily have to come from the same team, but each of 
  these areas need to be covered somehow.</li>
</ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving forward: A meeting to review all captured proposals will be set up 
  for early December. </li>
