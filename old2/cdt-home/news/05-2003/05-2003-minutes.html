The following was discussed:<br>

<ol>

<li> <b>ESC update:</b><p>
Several Eclipse events were held at the embedded systems conference in San
Francisco in April. The main
goal of the Eclipse events at ESC was to raise the awareness of Eclipse in
the embedded industry. The events held included an 
Eclipse breakfast, organized by Rational
and QNX, as well as a birds of a feather (BOF) session, that covered a
range of topics related to Eclipse and CDT in the embedded market. More
info on the BOF session can be found
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/news/bof-esc03/bof-esc-2003.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project"> here.</a><br>
</p>

<p>
Cory Bialowas also discussed his ESC activities. His main objective was to evangelize CDT
to the embedded community. Cory also discussed the Eclipse panel at ESC, which included
representatives from IBM, IBM/Rational, QNX, Timesys and Tensilica. Information Week
subsequently wrote an article based on the panel, which can be found 
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=9600064">here.</a><br>
Finally, Cory showed a very impressive demo at ESC -- he installed QNX Momentics, Rational's clearcase,
and an internal version of XDE for C++. He was then able to seamlessly create and edit a C++
QNX project and then switch to the XDE modelling tool and view/edit the model of the C++ project.
It was a powerful demonstration of integration between tools from different vendors in Eclipse.
</p>


<li> 
<b>CDT 1.1 status:</b><p>
Congratulations to the CDT 1.1 team! The CDT 1.1 has been released, and is 
available on the download page. Doug has also created
an update site, which will allow people to update to new versions through the Eclipse 
update mechanism. The possibility of a CDT 1.1.1 release was also discussed. At this point,
it was agreed that critical fixes would be put on the 1.1 branch, but that we would for feedback
from users and commercial companies as to whether we would formally create a 1.1.1 release.

</p>
</li>

<li> <b>CDT 1.x</b>
<p>
We discussed the timing of upcoming releases. The concensus was to target a 1.2 release
with an end of August release date, and a CDT 2.0 release for the end of the year (December).
As the core APIs are still in flux, the API freeze would be targetted at the 2.0 release. 
</p>
<p>
Alain discussed various debugger improvements that were on the roadmap for CDT 1.2 and 2.0.
This includes supporting gdb 5.4 and 5.5, which have made significant changes to the MI
interface. Work is also underway to round out the debugger features with the addition
of support for tracepoints. Alain will be posting a feature list to the mailing list.
Alain also discussed the core model, as well as the indexer.
</p>
<p>
Doug presented a roadmap for the CDT core components. This includes firming up
the build model, search capabilities, indexer rework, ongoing parser work, and the
addition of class wizards. The goal is to achieve parity with the JDT and support, with
2.0, a CDOM and allow features such as refactoring.
</p>
<p>
A C++ class browser was also discussed. This is something that Redhat mentionned they might be
able to take on. Another possibility that was discussed is that someone from QNX take that on. In
any case, a class browser would likely need some of the CDT core model work to be completed first.
</p>
<p>
Kleo (Rational) offered to help with the 1.2 and 2.0 scoping and plan. Kleo will be 
collecting the feature list for 1.2, posting it on the newsgroup, and offered to
track those activities.
</p>

</li>

<li><b>Other framework and features</b><p>
The only one discussed was the target model proposal. Thomas was not
on the call at that point, but he thought he could get a proposal to
the mailing list in late May</p>
<p>


<li> <b>Infrastructure</b><p>

Due to personal reasons, Judy has had to scale back her involvement
with CDT. I want to personally thank her for all of her efforts and hard work;
her energy and contributions will be missed. 
</p>
<p>
For the CDT 1.1 release, the builds have been automated through ant scripts,
and this is what was used. Doug has also automated the update site zip file
generation and upload, and we may move to that for the official CDT builds
as well. As for the web site, we are looking for volunteers to help out (Kleo
has offered to help in this area).
</p>

</li>

<li> <b>Documentation</b><p>

Rational is providing help in this area; work is ongoing. QNX will also
be donating raw content from our own tool suite documentation.

</p></li>

<li> <b>Verification</b><p>

The discussion on automated UI testing was postponed again, as there is no
concensus on the right commercial tool to use. The topic of host coverage was
then brought up. Redhat is doing some testing with different versions of RH 
distributions, while Timesys tests the CDT with different combinations of tools
and target systems. In order to assess the test coverage, it was thought best to
construct a matrix of all host/target combinations being tested to assess coverage.

</p><p>
QNX also offered that Peter Graves put together a basic test plan for CDT, based
upon our internal test plans. We could then ask the different participants to execute
that test plan on their combination of host/target.
</p></li>

<li><b>Varia:</b><p>

Redhat discussed the compiled version of Eclipse (gcj), which they now have running. This
provides significant speed increases over the Java version.
Redhat also talked about the port of Eclipse to a 64-bit architecture.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Any comments, additions, corrections etc. welcome!

As always, many thanks to everyone for your ongoing support.
