individuals from these companies that attended the call, that notes sheet has 
been misplaced...<p>&nbsp;<p>The following was discussed:

<li>Debugging work is continuing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The CDT registers view got abstracted out and pushed down into the Eclipse

opportunity to contribute from a C++ perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p><u><b>IBM-Rational:</b></u><ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Working to wrap up 2.0 features under development. Significant 
  recent additions include Scanner Configuration, selection search, background 
  search &amp; build.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Have provided a drop of the UI to IBM Translation centers to get 
  started on translations. Everyone's help to get strings externalized are 
  appreciated, the various translated properties files will be contributed back 
  into the project once they are available.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>

<p><u><b>Redhat</b></u>: 
<ol>
  <li>Hover help, profiling &amp; other plugins are ready for committing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Also working on a change logs plugin</li>
  </ol>
  <p><u><b>Altera:</b></u>
<ol>
  <li>CDT 1.2 based IDE engineering efforts wrapping up<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Coming up to speed on CDT 2.0, working on bringing plugins in line with a 
  view to contributing (ideally in 2.0 but likely later to avoid churn).</li>
  </ol>
  <p><u><b>Intel</b></u>:<ol>
    <li>Assisting in the managed build area, adding parser support. Patches 
    expected soon.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><u><b>Real 
  Time Innovations:</b></u>
    <ol>
      <li>Working with CDT 1.x, following along with 2.0 developmnets.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><u><b>MontaVista:</b></u><ol>
        <li>Not many cycles devoted to CDT, still based on 1.x. Cycles not 
        expected to free up until post 2.0</li>
        </ol>
        <p><u><b>Texas Instruments:</b></u><ol>
          <li>Eclipse 3.0 &amp; CDT 2.0 based product is in the works, not ready for 
          any announcement yet.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>There is a lot of buy-in at TI for contributing to Eclipse 
          projects, will be crystalizing on areas for contributions. One known 
          area for working on is Managed Build in order to support 
          mixed-language requirements.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><b>Rockwell:</b></u><ol>
            <li>Deploying CDT 1.2 to internal projects, still working so resolve 
            issues related to being able to contribute.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u><b>TimeSys:</b></u><ol>
              <li>Some work being done on translation unit identification ...</li>
              </ol>
              <p>&nbsp;<p><b>CDT 2.0 Status:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>No visible signs of progress in getting the committer permissions 
    re-organized or getting the component inboxes created yet.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>As we get closer to M9 (one month away), we need to start having some 
    discussions on how feature development is progressing and make some 
    decisions about which pieces to still keep in the release and which (if any) 
    we need to start thinking about delaying until later in order to avoid risky 
    churn past the M9 milestone. The late April timeframe was agreed to have 
    such a discussion, and Kleo Hapitas took an action to poll for status from 
    various teams to seed the discussion.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For items that we know are beyond the 2.0 timeframe, people are 
    encouraged to create bugzilla plan items to start generating ideas and 
    discussion. As an example, Doug Schaefer is planning to do some DOM 
    prototyping and could get that ball rolling by capturing some initial 
    information in a Bugzilla item &amp; taking it from there...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;<p>
<b>Documentation</b></li> </p>

              <ul>
                <li>There is a new person on the IBM-Rational team working on 
                CDT documentation (Dave Williams, can be contacted at
                <a href="mailto:Dave_Williams@ca.ibm.com">
                Dave_Williams@ca.ibm.com</a></li>
                <li>Dave's first goal will be to clean up some 1.2 documentation 
                before tacking additional content for the 2.0 release. Welcome 
                aboard Dave!</li>
                </ul>
