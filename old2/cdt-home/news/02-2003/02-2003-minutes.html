<ol>

<li>State of the CDT
<p>
Slides are posted on the web site that outline the CDT activities
over the last 6 months. These include the setting up of the project
infrastructure, updating of the debugger, and the CDT 1.0 release.
Please see the following <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/news/12-2002/cdt-state-dec.ppt?cvsroot=Tools_Project"> URL</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>Update from participants

<p>Lee Courtney gave an update on the work that Montavista has been doing
with Eclipse and the CDT. Unfortunately, due to other commitments,
Montavista has not been able to commit as much time to the CDT as originally planned. 
They are hoping to have more time to dedicate to the project in the new
year.</p>

<p>Tom Tromey gave an update on the activities at Redhat. Redhat has been
helping with the debugger on the gdb side, as well as with testing of the CDT. They
also have work underway for build and packaging of Eclipse, some Linux-specific
plugins and are looking into performance issues (again on Linux hosts).</p>

<p>
Doug Schaefer presented slides on Rational's direction. The slides can
be found on the CDT <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/news/12-2002/rational-cdt.ppt?cvsroot=Tools_Project"> website</a>.

Rational is gearing up with resources and will drive the development of the build model and CDOM.
</p>
<p>
Thomas Fletcher talked about QNX's activities. On top of being the main
commiters to the CDT, QNX has been working on integrating the CDT into their next
commercial release of Momentics.</p>
</li>

<li> New participants
<p>
Chris Songer from Tensilica prepared some slides giving background on
Tensilica as well as outlining their work with Eclipse and the CDT. The slides are on
the CDT <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/news/12-2002/tensilica-cdt.ppt?cvsroot=Tools_Project"> web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Timesys has been moving all of their tools to Eclipse. They are currently
migrating to the CDT, and have interest in helping with the builder and 
launcher.
</p>
<p>
Programming Research builds static analysis tools for C/C++ and Java. Their
interest in the CDT is to possibly integrate their analysis tools with
the CDT. Mark also mentioned that they have a lot of experience with C/C++
parsing, so they will probably be most involved with the CDOM/parser
discussions.
</p>
<p>
SAS builds products that use a variety of programming languages. They are
interested
in deploying Eclipse tools and the CDT internally, as well as investigate if
Eclipse could easily be used for their other programming languages. Ed
Burnette also brought
up the issue that the current CDT versioning is confusing for Eclipse users.
</p>
<p>
Macraigor builds emulators (JTAG/BDM) probes for a variety of processors.
They
have integration with gdb and are looking at leveraging that to provide
integration
with the CDT
</p>
<p>
Wasabi provides a commercial version of NetBSD. They are looking at Eclipse
and the CDT
as a possible development environment for NetBSD.
</p>
</li>

<li>Project infrastructure

<p>A couple of slides were presented on the updates to the project
infrastructure. See slides 3-5 of the "cdt-plan-dec.ppt" PowerPoint
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/cdt-home/news/12-2002/cdt-plan-dec.ppt?cvsroot=Tools_Project"> file</a>.
</p>
<p>
Main discussion points include
the need to better communicate activities (which everyone involved in the
CDT will have to make a conscious effort to do), as well as schedule monthly
conference calls.
</p>
</li>

<li>Planning

<p>Again, see the slide set called "cdt-plan-dec.ppt". Two main topics were
discussed, with a brief refresher on the goals of the CDT as an introduction.
</p>
<p>
First, the proposal for a CDT 1.0.1 release was presented. The CDT 1.0.1
release is essentially a maintenance release to address some issues with CDT 1.0 (bugfixes) as well
as round out the feature set. The proposed timeframe is to have a 1.0.1 candidate by the
middle of December, with a GA date by end of month. The 1.0.1 release would work with
Eclipse 2.0.2.
</p>
<p>
Interoperability with the 2.1 Eclipse stream will be investigated and if
possible, the CDT team will make the 1.0.1 release work with 2.1.
Everyone seemed in agreement with the 1.0.1 scope and timelines.
</p>
<p>
We then discussed development plans for the next 6 months. On top of minor
feature enhancements and bugfixes, some areas generated a lot of discussion and
interest. These include the builder, the CDOM/parser, target abstraction and launching, the
debugger, Cygwin, UI usability issues, user documentation, testing and GNUDE. The
approach that the CDT has chosen to take is to form teams from the interested participants
in those areas, start some discussions and formulate the feature/development
plans for those subsystems. The goal is to have a preliminary plan of action at
the next conference call in January.
</p>

<p>
Participants on the call expressed interest in the various areas, as
follows:</p>
<p>

<b>Builder and build model team</b>
<ul>
<li>Timesys
<li>Phil (Redhat)
<li>Chris (Tensilica)
<li>Brian Moyle (Montavista)
<li>Sean and Doug (Rational)
<li>Alain and Dave (QNX)
<li>Ed Burnette (SAS)
</ul>

<b>CDOM/parser team</b>
<ul>
<li>Doug and John (Rational)
<li>Alain (QNX)
<li>Mark (Programming Research)
<li>Tom (Redhat)
<li>Sam (Timesys)
</ul>

<b>Target abstraction and launching team</b>
<ul>
<li>Thomas (QNX)
<li>Brian Moyle (Montavista)
<li>Chris (Tensilica)
<li>Sam (Timesys)
<li>Tom (Redhat)
<li>Martin (Rational)
<li>Jim (Macraigor)
</ul>

<b>Debugger and GDB versioning</b>
<ul>
<li>Mikhail and Alain (QNX)
<li>Tom/Elena (Redhat) 
</ul>

<b>Cygwin and UI usability</b>
<ul>
<li>TBD (Judy and Chris have expressed interest in the usability issues)
</ul>


<b>User documentation</b>
<ul>
<li>Rational
<li>Chris (Tensilica)
<li>Brian (Montavista)
<li>Thomas (QNX)
<li>Redhat
</ul>

<b>Testing</b>
<ul>
<li>QNX
<li>Rational
<li>Sam Robb (Timesys)
<li>Tom (Redhat)
</ul>

<b>GNUDE (Linux/GNU development environment)</b>
<ul>
<li>Phil (Redhat)
<li>Tom (Redhat)
<li>Timesys
<li>Montavista
<li>Wasabi
</ul>
</p><p>
In most cases, I'll be looking for someone to drive those discussions (team
lead).
If you want to volunteer, please let me know; in some cases, someone's
already
driving those activities (e.g. Doug and John at Rational are working on
CDOM).
We probably will also create specific areas on the web site to outline the 
plans and progress in these specific areas.
</p>
</li>

<li> Varia
<p>
A few more points were discussed during the meeting. <br>
This includes:
<ul>
<li>the hurdles faced by new participants (ISV's) to the CDT, which have a
hard time
figuring out where to start in doing integration. The overall architecture
of the CDT
needs to be documented better, and we need a document that covers how ISV's
would
integrate with the CDT. Thomas volunteered to start such a document.
<li>the CDT should probably also publish some "how-to"'s on the common 
integration/extensions that ISV's want to do, e.g. how to launch with your
own version
of gdb, how to extend the builder and so on. This would probably go a long
way
in helping with CDT integration.
<li>It was also suggested that we ask folks to write "how-to's" for the CDT
(maybe we
could offer some free T-shirts as reward).
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ol><p>

Again, I want to thank everyone for attending the call, and appreciate
everyone's
continued support.

Sebastien
