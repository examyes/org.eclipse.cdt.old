Instructions for building the Eclipse CDT from a command line using ANT.
The build scripts will be posted to CVS cdt-home/downloads/buildscripts directory.
Alternately you may receive these instructions with a zip of the build scripts.


NOTE:

Future.
I can see that it should be relatively simple to add a stage to compile the C/C++ source
to regenerate the currently stored binary files.

Instructions:

System Requirements:
Ant 1.4 or higher --> http://jakarta.apache.org/
JDK 1.3 --> http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/R-2.0.1-200208291828/java-runtimes.html
CVS 1.10 or higher  --> http://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList

300 meg free disk space
Source build files from Eclipse CVS repo --> ** /tools/cdt-home/downloads/buildscripts

Initial Setup:
Install Ant, a JDK, and a CVS client, as per each program's instructions.
Minimally you will need the following environment variables set.

--Add the Ant bin directory, and the CVS executable to your path.
--Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the root of your JDK installation.
--Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the root of your Ant installation.
--(Windows 98) Set the HOME environment variable to c:
--(Windows 98) Increase the default environment space as specified here.


1) Install a clean installation of Eclipse 2.0.1
   --You will need all the plugins and features
    for all platforms that you want to build--

  They can reside in the same plugin directory,
  but you will have to download the full installation
  for each platform in order to get the plugins.

2) Navigate to the plugins and features directories
    Remove the version number from all plugin and feature directory names

3) Obtain the build scripts from CVS

4) Checkout the contents of the cdt-home/downloads/buildscripts directory into the eclipse install directory

5) Edit the startCDT-<os><win>build.bat files
    build -os win32 -ws win32 -install "C:\eclipse"
      e.g. rename -install <installDir> to point to your clean Eclipse installation directory

6)run the startCDT-<os><win>build.bat file of your choice

7) The resulting distribution.zip and source zips will reside in
    <installDir>/features/org.eclipse.cdt-feature/
